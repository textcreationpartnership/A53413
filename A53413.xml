            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot but acquaint you, that many of your Friends here in <hi>England</hi> are much concern'd that the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> (that is, Myſtical <hi>Babylon)</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured no more to ſupport you when you uſurped the Imperial Crown of this Realm; and that when God gave the Nation Grace to drive you and your Italian Triggrimate and Welch Cub from amongſt us, he did not move both Heaven and Earth to reſtore you again: And that ſince you have fought many a bloody Battel for the Honour of the Engliſh Nation, you would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one more as an additional One to ſave the Crown on your Head. Truly, <hi>Sir, Rome</hi>'s Prelat did not deal well by you, nor you by your ſelf. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it appeared to your Red-Letter Friends, as if the Grandeur of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion and Superſtition had been your Gracious Aim and Deſign, and that not without Reaſon; for in a moſt decent manner you loſt the Crown, and the little Gentleman his Dominion: Nay, they hold up their Hands, lift up their Eyes, and curſe that old Coxcomb <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. as the worſt and baſeſt of Men, that betrayed the Intereſt of the Church, in not doing his Duty to which he was obliged, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſeconding ſuch a Glorious Deſign and Undertaking: But this thing he never did, nor do I believe any of his Succeſſors ever will; for in my Conſcience I believe they have too much Senſe to attempt the Support of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houſe, notwithſtanding the Conduct and Courage they may pretend to, in Caſes that are of that Weight and Difficulty. It's true, <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> pretended he was to act, but 'twas according to his own Reaſon, not according to your Senſe, which if he had followed, he might have abdicated <hi>Rome</hi> the very Day you were driven out of <hi>England:</hi> Therefore what a Varlet you had to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al judg you. Truly he ſaw that you were loſing, and that you did in time in a comfortable way quit the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore ought to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed even the Papacy on your behalf: But he was ſo far from that piece of Heroick Juſtice, that I am perſwaded the old Prieſt would ſcarce have ſacrificed a Sop in his Dripping-Pan to your Service. Well then, what's next? Since the Church left you, I pray what hath the French Monarch done for you? I muſt confeſs he hath done more for you than the Church did, for ſhe left you betimes, but he allows you a good Penſion, and hath not as yet taken it away; he does not give and take away Penſions at pleaſure, and ſay, he hath no Money; no, it is below him. But what is the Reaſon he doth not come over with you, and fix your ſweet Bum in the Royal Chair, and return (as you ſaid he would) to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100711:4"/>
               <hi>France</hi> again, without putting us to the Charge of a Jack of ſmall Beer for his Pains? Or ſince both the Pope and French King have not done their Duties, what's the Reaſon that you, being a Man of Courage, (ask <hi>Tom Jenner</hi> elſe) that has fought ſo many bloody Battels for the Honour to the Engliſh Nation, and on behalf of the Crown, (tho Old <hi>Hodg,</hi> and a Conclave of Inferiour Clergy-men conſulted all the Hiſtory of your Life, but could not find one Word of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which ſav'd them from the Gallows) did not fight one ſingle Battel to keep the Crown upon your Head? You might have done it, and your Clothes have ſat never the worſe upon your Back. Well, you had the Courage to run, and needs muſt when the Devil drives, and ſo there is the End of an old Song.</p>
            <p>I have thought upon your Caſe with as much deliberation as ever the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Logger-head of a Prieſt did of getting a Biſhoprick, by threatning us with diſputed Titles, and an endleſs War, and yet could never make any thing you ever ſaid or did to be of a Piece: Therefore I ſhall ask you a few Queſtions, and hope you will give me the Satisfaction that one Gentleman ought to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I do not mean thereby to challenge you, for I am no Swords-man I aſſure you, and I think you never took any great delight in one, unleſs it was to hang by your Side. As for your Enemies, I think you ſcarce ever fought with any, unleſs it were at the <hi>Old-Baily, Kings-Bench</hi> Court, or <hi>Weſtern-Circuit,</hi> where the Odds were ten thouſand to one on your Side: therefore I mean by Satisfaction, a plain honeſt Anſwer to the following Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I remember the villanous Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> took it as a great Affront, that our Parliament in <hi>England</hi> could not reconcile the Security of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with the admitting of you to be King. Now theſe Biſhops, poor Rogues, had clear another Notion of the Buſineſs, and thought it might be done with as much eaſe, as for an Engliſh Man to catch the Itch in a Scotiſh Laird's Houſe, and therefore went roundly to work, and procured your Brother to call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and conſtitute you High-Commiſſioner; which was no ſooner ſaid but done, and your Succeſſion ſettled; and truly you appeared very formidable in that Kingdom: Nay, the Government there did in a manner protect you from the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> that would have excluded you; Nay, Dr. <hi>Naſty-Guſts,</hi> the then Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> found they had done the Buſineſs ſo well, that he bleſt God the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> had made ſuch a happy Progreſs in reducing the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Will of the King. Now after all this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was made about you, pray how came it that you found no more Friends in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Truly at one time I thought the Courtiers there would have pull'd out both their Eyes to have ſerved you; yet when you ſtood in need of them, there were but few that appeared for you. Truly poor Pilgarlick did ſtand and wonder at the thing; and adviſing with a parcel of honeſt Fellows over a Diſh of Coffee at a Coffee-houſe near the Old Houſe, out of which the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> warned you to be gone without any more to do; one of the Company was very frank in the Point, and told the Company plainly, that Fear and Intereſt were the two great Hinges on which the Actions of Mankind did turn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſinuated that Fear made them ſtand for you againſt the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Intereſt made them be againſt you with K. <hi>William.</hi> Well, what then? Truly I thought with my ſelf, that the Princes of this World ought to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100711:4"/>
to a very high degree, and to have a Magazine of Aſſurance, becauſe their Favours are more acceptable than their Perſons are beloved. I confeſs Princes are in a fair way to be beloved when they put themſelves in a Poſture of doing much good; and that Prince is ſure of the Affections of his People, who will endeavour with all ſweetneſs to gain their Hearts. I have therefore this one thing to ſay, that if you had ſecured your Antient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you might have done mighty things. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> why did you not cultivate your natural Qualities, in order to have ſecured you an Intereſt in that Kingdom? Truly the Reaſon is plain, becauſe you had none about you but mercenary Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals that ruined you by their Flatteries. And did you not find your ſelf in a moſt forlorn Solitude, notwithſtanding their Scots Careſſes, when you really ſtood in need of their help? And ſhould K. <hi>William</hi> have any of your Rogues about him, I can not but think they would ſerve him as they did you, leave him when he has moſt need of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You having converſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Biſhops there hanging about you, and giving you all the Scots Government could afford, I pray reſolve me what Religion thoſe Rogues were of? Certainly if they were Proteſtants, they have ſhewed themſelves to have as little Brains as your Worſhip; for I find by their management of themſelves whilſt you afforded them your Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as well as before and ſince you left us, they neither underſtood the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their Traiterous Hierarchy, nor of Religion. In a word, one would think by the Current of their Actions, they had been a parcel of Iriſh Teagues trick'd up with the Dreſs of a true Scots Clergy-man; for they muſt ſurely be judg'd Sots to the higheſt Degree, if ignorant of the Diſguſt they had cauſed in the People of that Kingdom, by embracing your Gracious Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, in favour of the villanous Popiſh Crew.</p>
            <p>It may be you will ſay, that to your own knowledg they were Proteſtants at the Bottom. To this I anſwer, That what either your Brother or you ever ſaid, weighed no more with me than if you had ſworn <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots had lived and died an honeſt true Engliſh Virgin. But what is it to the Point what they were at the Bottom? I am ſure they and you were a parcel of Sowce-Crowns, to think the Scots would long endure Popery and Arbitrary Power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to domineer over them. Truly Experience hath taught us, (tho you and your villanous Scots Biſhops were above ſuch Teachings) that the poor Scots wanted but a Leader of Reſolution and Bravery, and they had thrown off your Brother's Yoke and yours long before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You may ſay, becauſe they wrote to you, and told you that the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was <hi>a deteſtable Invaſion,</hi> therefore you judg'd them Proteſtants, they alſo having been always againſt ſuch things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems they were for Paſſive-Obedience and Non-reſiſtance: For I do not find that they, or any of their Admirers, ſtirred one ſtep to ſerve you; and you know that Gracious Doctrine has ſaved the Credit of many a Coward in the World; and therefore your Brother and you promoted it with all the Zeal two ſuch Babes of Grace could ſhew, leſt the true Proteſtant Intereſt ſhould have ſtorm'd <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all the Helliſh Crew ſhe has nouriſhed ever ſince your Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration till this Day. But they were pleaſed to ſay, that the Glorious Enterprize
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100711:5"/>
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was <hi>a deteſtable Invaſion.</hi> What! did this beſpeak them to be Proteſtants? Well then let me tell you, that your Great Ally might as well wear the Name, and all the French Court, and your villanous Party here at home, for I believe they have ſaid ſo ten thouſand times: But I do no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were Proteſtants, than I believe Old <hi>Hodg</hi> an honeſt Man, or <hi>R. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> to be without three falſe Quarters. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> what did they do for the Proteſtant Intereſt? We had ſeven Biſhops (good Lord) went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and all for the ſake of the Proteſtant Religion: I was not a bit ſorry, nor ſhould I have been if all the twenty ſix had gone upon the ſame Account, tho they had lain by it as long as I and the reſt of my fellow Priſoners did in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience: But what your Engliſh-Biſhops did for the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, I will leave to better Pens; but for your Scots Tools, did they not by their Treachery and Lewdneſs render themſelves the Abomination of the People?</p>
            <p n="3">3. I pray let me ask you a third Queſtion, What was the Reaſon that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Advice of your Deviliſh Jeſuits to the contrary, you would not ſtay and ſee the joyful Sight the People of <hi>England</hi> ſaw, and that after ſo many Diviſions occaſioned by your Brother's Reign and yours, <hi>viz.</hi> Our King and the Parliament ſo happily united together? You ſay you ventured your Life on behalf of the Nation; and ſince your Grace and Favour was ſuch, as not to ſtrike one Stroke to keep the Crown upon your Head, you might have been ſo good-natur'd as to have ſtaid and ſeen our King leaving his Intereſt to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Parliament, on purpoſe to take care of theirs and his, and the Welfare of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The King (God bleſs him) remitted Chimney-money, and entirely threw himſelf upon the Affections of his People, and you threw your ſelf upon the Affection of the French King. I pray try his Affection, and let me know by the next how he uſes you, and why you would not gratify your ſweet ſelf with this goodly Sight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Your Villains are ever and anon checking me with my being convicted for two pretended Perjuries, eſpecially a Friend of yours in a certain Place where your Name is ſometimes mentioned, but not much to the Advantage of you or your Villanous Crew. You being a Man of great Judgment and Conſcience, I ask you whether or no for ſuch a Villain to be in a Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King with three Couſin-Germans at once, or to have a Hand in, or juſtifying the forging of a Seal to hold an Eſtate, or ſuborning of Witneſſes to ſwear that that was as falſe as any thing under the Sun could be true, whoſe own dear Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion died upon the Spot with a falſe Oath in his Mouth, ought not rather to have held his Tongue, and let me alone, and ſat down with ſilence, till he had cleared himſelf and Family in the firſt place? The Fellow had once a Command, but wanting Courage, Conduct, Honour and Honeſty, he was fairly diſmiſſed. If you are willing, I ſuppoſe he is ready to ſerve you in a mean Capacity, a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rather than fail, being conſcious in himſelf that his Reputation in the World will not engage him to a much greater Truſt: Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> he may make a Prieſt if you pleaſe, for I think he is too lewd to be a Layman.</p>
            <p>I have more Queſtions to ask you, but I will not give you the trouble now, but ask you only how you do, and how my Landlady and the little Cub have their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100711:5"/>
Health? I ſuppoſe you have kept a merry <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> at <hi>St. Germains;</hi> and I hope you will keep <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> there or elſewhere abroad till you draw your laſt Breath. I underſtand the French King takes much pleaſure in your Company; I do not envy his Happineſs in the leaſt, and ſhall no more mourn for it than an old Friend of yours did for his Father's Death, after he had cheated the old Gentleman of a fair Eſtate, and left him four hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> as a <hi>ſine Cura<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the better to enable him to drink Ale in his old Age: He now and then bellows for you as loud as ſome Cattel do when they want Fodder, with whom he hath had to do in his Life-time. O had the Courage of his Hands kept pace with the Rhodomontades of his villanous Tongue, for ought I know he and Sir <hi>John Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> might have done Wonders towards your changing the Air you live in. I have ſeen him hugging that Traitor as the Devil hugg'd the Witch; and being a dutiful obedient Child to his old Sire, you would do well to ſend the Tiler's Son to learn of him. But I haſten to your Charge, and proceed to the twenty ſecond Article, which you will do well to conſider.</p>

                  <hi>Article</hi> XXII.</head>
               <p>YOUR Brother and you were very induſtrious in miſapplying of the Taxes and Subſidies given by Parliament: When they gave Money for any one or more particular Uſes, it is well known that for the moſt part they were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, to the great hazard of the Kingdom: But here I muſt particularize.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Parliament in lieu of ſeveral Advantages the Crown made, by which publick Houſe-keeping was maintained in your Father's Reign, to the Glory of the Engliſh Nation, gave the Hereditary Exciſe, and took thoſe Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Act of Parliament, who thought of nothing leſs than that the Publick Tables ſhould have been kept up: But you and your Brother having travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and having not been much troubled with the ſmell of Victuals, when you were come home you began your Show with open Houſe-keeping; but it was ſo offenſive to your tender Stomachs that it was laid aſide, judging your manner of living at <hi>Bruxels</hi> more ſutable to the Conſtitutions of your Bodies: And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laying down of Houſe-keeping, you know what uſe the Hereditary Exciſe was put to, againſt the Intent and Meaning of the Act of Parliament that ſettled it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Cuſtoms were given by Parliament in a great meaſure for the Support of the Navy, which is the Bulwark of <hi>England:</hi> But how they were applied to that Uſe, let all the World judg; part of the Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> having been paid in Penſions, and a great part for ſecret Services. I am ſure when the King had occaſion either to repair or fit out a Fleet, or build Ships, a particular Tax was made for thoſe Purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Brother was forced to borrow a great Sum of Money of the City, nay ſeveral in the Year 1664, at which many ſtood in admiration how he ſhould lie under ſuch a neceſſity of Money. 'Tis true, there was a great Army to be paid off and disbanded, but for that the Convention had made a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, had it not been miſapplied; and he had the Exciſe ſettled on him, valued at 500000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> the Cuſtoms then valued at 600000 <hi>l.</hi> the Chimney-Money 150000 <hi>l.</hi> the Arrears of twelve Months Aſſeſſment commencing the <hi>25th</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100711:6"/>
of <hi>December</hi> 1659: The Poſt-Office, which was valued at 50000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and the Arrears of the Exciſe and new Impoſts: And in the ſecond Seſſion of the Long Parliament, he had given him 1270000 <hi>l.</hi> and a Benevolence, and 60000 <hi>l.</hi> to the poor Cavaleers, to gratify them in ſome meaſure for drinking the King's Health, and a farther Relief to the poor maimed Officers who had ſerved your Father in the late Wars he wickedly raiſed againſt his People; and alſo four intire Subſidies by the Laity, and four by the Clergy; beſides the forfeited Eſtates of thoſe that put your Father to death, whether in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> Now ſeeing after all this your Brother was in Debt ſo ſoon after his Reſtoration, can we conclude any otherwiſe than that you joined together to ſpend thoſe Revenues, Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in other ways than the Parliament intended? Pray how much did you receive out of the Treaſury for Secret Service, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a whole Regiment of Trapans, from one end of the Kingdom to the other? If there was ſuch a neceſſity of trapanning, why was not the Parliament moved for an Eſtabliſhment to keep thoſe Rogues (that drew poor Men into Plots, and then ſwore againſt them, nay for hearing the Treaſon they themſelves ſpake) in conſtant pay? But when the Parliament had given Money for the Honour and Safety of the Government, you ſpent it upon theſe Men that diſturbed its Peace, and rendred it vile and contemptible: And the Money given to fit out a Fleet, was expended chiefly in rigging up a Fleet of Land Fire-ſhips, a parcel of naſty Whores that were even the Scandal of their own Profeſſion of Whoring, as alſo the much admired Pimps and Bawds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You know the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1665, gave a mighty Tax of 2500000 <hi>l.</hi> by which we thought the War againſt the Dutch would have been carried on with great Vigour and Application, the Money being given for that End; and truly we did provide a Fleet, but then what Uſe 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> was put to, the Seamen not being paid, is worth the knowing. You may remember lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was done in the War in 1666, it being famous for Sir <hi>Robert Holms</hi>'s admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expedition to the <hi>Fly,</hi> where he burnt 150 Fiſher-boats, and the never-to-be-forgotten Fire of <hi>London:</hi> But your Brother and you having occaſion for the aforeſaid Sum, you fitted out no Fleet in 1667, for your Mother had aſſured your Brother and you, that the French King had told her the Dutch would not be out that Year, and ſo we lay ſtill: But the Dutch provided for War, and came to ſave us ſome Charges, and burnt our Ships in <hi>Chatham-</hi>Harbour. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I obſerve, that tho your Brother was merry and feeding his Ducks, yet there was not a Penny of Money, and therefore the Parliament was called, and when the time of their Sitting came, they provided Money for the Dutch who wanted our Money; and we wanting Peace, were forced to take ſuch a Peace as the French King would give us.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> do but obſerve, that had we applied the Money given to carry on the Dutch War to that uſe, our Ships had not (to our great Diſhonour) been burnt in Port. But, I pray, what uſe was 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> put to? You know your Brother had contracted a great Debt with <hi>Cleveland</hi> that naſty Whore, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Debt to the Pimps, who, poor Rogues, had had no great matter of Pay in two Years; and the poor Men that fired <hi>London</hi> were not to be ſlighted, for <hi>the Labourer was worthy of his Hire.</hi> Your Prieſts complained, and their Mouths were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100711:6"/>
to be ſtop'd; and the Queen-Mother muſt have a Preſent for interpoſing with the French King for that baſe Peace: So that truly there was little or no Money left. Thus you may ſee what was the diſmal Effect of this miſapplying the Publick Money. Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may remember that the Seamen came down in great Bodies to you for Pay; and ſome of them were in a moſt gracious manner apprehended, and hanged for only asking for their Own, which they had ſo dearly earned with the hazard of their Lives.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I muſt not omit telling you, that after the Peace with the Dutch was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, tho but a baſe one, yet we that eſpouſed their Cauſe at that time, were exceeding glad of the Peace: There was a Triple League concluded between the Swede, the Dutch, and our Selves, for which great Sums of Money were given, as well for a Compenſation to the King's Grace in making it, as to help him to ſupport it, in order to bridle the French King's Inſolence: So that your Brother had two Millions and a half <hi>Sterling</hi> in one Year's time for this Triple League; but it is well known that upon the ſtrength of this Stock a Peace was clapt up with the French King, the Triple League ſhamefully broken, the ſecond wicked War made upon the Dutch, and the <hi>Exchequer</hi> ſhut up, and all this thrô the Miſapplication of the Treaſure of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> let me obſerve this to you, that your Brother by this Triple League had gained much of the Love of his People, and you your ſelf ſhared in it too, tho you had no hand in that League, unleſs it were to break it, which the People did not ſee for ſome time. The Deſign of your Siſter's coming being very dark, it paſt only for a bare Interview: But <hi>Coventry</hi> was a conſiderable Gainer, whilſt another loſt 2200 <hi>l.</hi> in the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> had 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and above 100000 Piſtols of the French King, for his ſpecial Service in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: All the Miniſters ſent to Foreign Courts to damn that good Work, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, even Sir <hi>William Lockyard</hi> eſcaped not the French King's Favour for the Service he did in that Affair: But tho your Brother had not only reconciled his Parliament to him, by ſeverely treating the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> for all the good Service, and united them ſo to him by this League, that they were ready to give him all they had, yet the Tables were quite turned when they ſaw into his Proceedings, and hated him and you too as ſuch Villanous Tools to ſatisfy (if poſſible) the French King's Pride and Ambition: Nay, ſome of your Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites were ſo offended at theſe ungodly Miſcarriages, that they could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Reſentments of this villanous Miſapplication of the Treaſure of the Nation, that it coſt them their Places in the Committee of Foreign Affairs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Remember that your Band of Penſioners gave the King another ſmall Spell of 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> for his extraordinary Occaſions; one would have thought thoſe Liberal Givers deſigned it for carrying on the War, but it was ſo ill a One, that thoſe Scoundrels were aſhamed of it, and would not ſay it was for that Uſe, tho they had a pretty deal of Cabbage out of it for their own extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. How was the reſt ſpent? Was it applied to the fitting out your Fleet? No, there was a French Supply for that, and this was made uſe of for an Army that was to have paid themſelves out of the Treaſure, not of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> but of <hi>London;</hi> which being ſmoaked in time, the Army was in part ordered to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, and Money given for that Uſe; but you made bold to ſend them into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100711:7"/>
the French Service, and the Money was made uſe of to other Purpoſes of far greater Advantage to the Conſpirators at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. There was a Tax of 600000 <hi>l.</hi> given for building and furniſhing of Ships with very great Eaſe; for your Penſioners were willing to confirm their Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, or elſe they had been undone; and ſince their Hand was in, they gave the additional Exciſe of Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, for three Years: Which Liberality of theirs was an abſolute <hi>Orvietan</hi> againſt a Diſſolution. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> what Ships were built that were of Service? I think you had better have called it an Act for the extraordinary Occaſions of the villanous Builders, for they got part of the Money, and we but a few uſeleſs Ships: Nay, I think ſome of the Ship-money was applied to ſupply the extraordinary Occaſions of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> that naſty Whore, and the reſt of the Pimps and Bawds at <hi>Whitehall:</hi> And upon the ſtrength of the Additional Exciſe, you and your Conſpirators moſt bravely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured your Counſels, in order to make the Nation die the ſecond Death.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There was 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> given your Brother to enter into an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> yet with that you clapt up a more cloſe Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and with the Act you and your Conſpirators begged a Million of Money; this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of your Miſapplication of the Nation's Treaſure. But this by the way obſerve, that this Peace which you and your Conſpirators made with <hi>France</hi> was but a Treacherous one; and it manifeſted both your Brother and you to be ſuch Perſons with whom the Nation's Money was not to be truſted, ſince the truſting you with ſuch immenſe Sums tended ſo much to the endangering the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Your Penſioners finding there was no War made againſt <hi>France</hi> in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſaid Act, and that the Army was a great Grievance to the Nation, gave ſix hundred and odd thouſand Pounds to disband them; yet with that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney you rather augmented your Forces, and kept up your Army to the great hazard of the Peace of the Kingdom. Nay, Sir, in a word, to order the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in a Bill ſo as to prevent its being embezeled, was argument enough to make it miſcarry, for you choſe rather to go without it than it ſhould be appropriated to any particular uſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Penſioner Parliament having been your Drudges for eighteen Years, and beginning to have their Eyes a little too much opened, it was high time to part with them: therefore having granted the aforeſaid Sum of 600 and odd thouſand Pounds to disband the Army, and the additional Duty upon Wines for three Years, and being that Seſſions diſpoſed to give no more Money, your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having ſworn on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> (laying his Sacred Hands upon <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouths</hi> bare B—for the greater ſolemnity of the Buſineſs) that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Parliament, came to the Houſe on Monday the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1678, and prorogued them to the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi> but on the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was by Proclamation diſſolved, and the ſame Day Writs iſſued out for the Meeting of a new one at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following, which was juſt forty Days between the Teſt and Return.</p>
               <p>This Parliament being ſat down, and finding the Army was a great Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Nation, and like to be of fatal Conſequence if maintained, paſſed a Bill for the raiſing one hundred and ninety odd thouſand Pounds to disband it:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100711:7"/>
and tho this was but a new Parliament, yet they underſtood your Brother's old Practices, and yours too, of putting the Monies to uſes never intended by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and therefore reſolved never to truſt you any more in the Matter of Money; for as this was the leaſt Tax, ſo it was the laſt that ever your Brother ſaw from any Parliament in his Reign.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Another demonſtration of the Point in hand, was the immenſe Sums <hi>Chif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch</hi> and the Privy Purſe iſſued out for thoſe Uſes the Parliament never intended, who deſign'd the Money they had ſo freely given to defray the publick Charge of the Nation: but ſince <hi>Chiffinch</hi> had the diſpoſal of ſo much, why did not the Parliament give that Raſcally Pimp, and the Whore his—who was Whore and Papiſt enough (as well as a Dutcheſs) to ſerve you, <hi>Sir,</hi> a ſwinging Sum for their extraordinary Occaſions, for they were both Labourers in this Vineyard? And truly the work of the Night lying upon their Hands ſomewhat too hard, they took in a Rogue that was a Fellow-labourer with them till the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> II. And who had the gracious Opportunity of robbing his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet we cannot tell; but old <hi>Chiffinch,</hi> if alive, could: and, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you will have it examined who robb'd yours, I believe a little Matter might find you out the Man; I have ſeen the Rogue go to Chappel-Prayers, now Maſs is out of Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as devoutly as any Pimp or Bawd about <hi>Whitehall</hi> ever did in yours or your Brother's Time.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may ſee the juſt Judgment of Almighty God upon you; for as you joined with your Brother and a parcel of thorow-pac'd Rogues to embezle the Nation's Money to ſupport a Crew of Pimps, Bawds, Whores, and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Cutthroats, and Murderers; ſo your grand Pimp, and his villanous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, embezled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If any of your Brother's Whores, Pimps, or Bawds, or yours, were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to turn Papiſt to oblige you, and continue in your Favour, had not they leave to keep a ſtiff-rump'd Prieſt, or ſo, to help them in their great Affairs of procuring a Catholick By-Whore, or Whores, with whom through Confeſſion they were acquainted? And, <hi>Sir,</hi> did they not pimp at a more reaſonable Rate than <hi>Chiffinch</hi> or his Deputy did, in order to promote the Catholick Cauſe?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Did you not ſupport and maintain a great number of them, to the Tune of <hi>eighteen Pence a Day,</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, for the Service of your Italian Comrade, at the Expence of the Publick, for ſecret Service? And what ſecret Service they did, Mrs. <hi>Junipor</hi> can tell, I ſuppoſe, as well if not better than your ſweet ſelf: and theſe being well paid, was it not your Care to have them Men of good Parts, tho of little or no Learning?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Did not your Brother and you, and your Council, put a Teſt upon theſe Prieſts, that they ſhould be true to yours and the French King's Intereſt, and not refuſe any Service in order thereunto that lay in their Power?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Were not theſe Prieſts your Spies and Trapans about the Kingdom, to draw Men into Plots and Conſpiracies? And did they not do your Buſineſs in thoſe Caſes with that Dexterity, that you gained your point of murdering ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, and rendering the poor Diſſenters obnoxious to your Penſioner Parliament, in order to get ſevere Laws made againſt them, whilſt your villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Romiſh Prieſts ſlept in a whole Skin; and Meetings of Proteſtants uſed with all the Violence imaginable, whilſt theſe Men walked about the Streets, going from Houſe to Houſe, and exerciſing their Functions with impunity?

               <p>THE Loſs of the Dominion of the Seas was wholly owing to the Treachery of you and your villanous Party. 'Tis true, your Brother did attempt the Security of the Seas, in ſupplying the defect of his Coin by a few Copper Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, whereby his Sacred Reſolution was made publick, of claiming and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Dominion of the Seas: but finding that ſort of Metal would not do, he changed them into Lead, and ſo the Buſineſs was done to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as if your Miniſter <hi>Ned Petre</hi> had contrived the Buſineſs himſelf, without the help of his Fellow-labourer of <hi>Penſilvania</hi> in that mighty Work. But I ſhall be very plain in this Point, and ſhew the Steps you took, whilſt Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England,</hi> to betray the Engliſh Nation into the Loſs of the Dominion of the Seas, which was never attempted till your Brother was called Home by the People of <hi>England,</hi> in company with your ſelf, when you were advanced to that great Place of Truſt, which you held for ſeveral Years to the Nation's great Diſhonour; and when you quitted the Employment, you procured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your own Nomination to ſucceed you, who like Villains purſued the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you gave them in executing that Office, by which the aforeſaid Loſs was, to your Heart's content, in a great meaſure compleated. I remember ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Brother's Reſtoration, the French King obtained leave of him and you to bring 12 Ships of War thrô the Channel; but I do not remember of late Years he ever asked ſuch a Boon of either of you, nor indeed do I find that any of his Men of War did willingly obſerve you ſo far, as to give ours the Honour of the Flag, or ſtrike to us in the Channel. Now pray obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Did you not, inſtead of able Seamen of known Experience and Courage, prefer a parcel of ignorant and cowardly Raſcals, Footmen, Pages, Pimps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Captains and Lieutenants, to the great diſcouragement of the Seamen? And for a Man to be an able Seaman, was enough to incapacitate him for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, you judging the Commands of the Royal Navy too great and high for ſuch Men. Did not your Creatures then and ſince ſay, that the King's Caſtles were not built to be commanded by Tarpawlins? And what Conduct there was ſince your diſpoſing of the Commands of the Fleet, is well remembred, as alſo how ridiculous it was judged, both by the Dutch, French, and other Nations, that did, and ſtill do advance their Navigation.</p>
               <p>It is true, when your Brother came home, he found a Noble Navy in good Order, and the Fleet in good Hands: But as Captains and Lieutenants died, or were diſcharged the Service, either by Age or otherwiſe, the aforeſaid Rogues were put in their Places, who when they came home from any Voyage, have many times put themſelves under the protection of the Friars, that with peace they might ſpend their Money in Whoring and Drinking, and have lived ſo lewdly as to be a Reproach even to the Friars where they ſheltered themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you took no Care of good Officers, ſo neither of the Breed of Seamen, for all the Fiſhery of <hi>England</hi> is ſunk to nothing. You let the French raviſh the <hi>New-found-Land</hi> Trade, by which that Fiſhery is loſt, and the <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade is gone, and the Northern Fiſhery is come to nothing, as is alſo the <hi>Iſeland</hi> Trade.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100711:9"/>
The French and Dutch are Maſters of theſe Fiſheries, and we have nothing now leſt but the <hi>Yarmouth-Fiſhery,</hi> which is fallen above 70 in the Hundred. It is moſt notorious that your Brother and you were Enemies to the Happineſs, Glory and Strength of the Nation, and therefore made it your Buſineſs to deſtroy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that might contribute to the Advancement thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In order to loſe the Dominion of the Seas, as you took no Care of the Increaſe of Seamen, ſo how were thoſe that you impreſſed aboard the Fleet under your Command, uſed by your Land-loping Raſcals, that could ſignalize themſelves no other ways than by breaking the Seamens Bones? Nay, their Warrant-Officers, it may be, did not eſcape their Hands. This Uſage made Men chuſe rather to loſe their Pay, and run from their Ships: An Inſtance of which we had in the <hi>Succeſs,</hi> a Fifth-rate Frigot, (beſides other Ships) where 50 Seamen, together with the Watch that looked to them, went away in the Night becauſe of their ill uſage by theſe mean Raſcals that knew not the Worth and Value of a Seaman. This was the Diſeaſe that raged in a great part of the Fleet, which made them quit the Engliſh Service, and go into Foreign Services, where they expected better Uſage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How have our Seamen been deſtroyed by thoſe wicked Wars you made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dutch, and baſe Compliance with the Pirats of <hi>Algiers,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering our Seamen to lie in Captivity till they died, or were uſeleſs, unleſs they could redeem themſelves at the Market-price? By this means we loſt the uſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred Seamen. The laſt good Peace that was made, was by Sir <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> but ever ſince we have been betrayed by your Villains in that Particular. I remember that ſeveral times Letters Patents were granted to collect the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Benevolence of well-diſpoſed People; but that when conſiderable Sums have been gathered, they have been put into the Hands of Cheats, who perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Money to their own Uſes, and let the poor Seamen periſh in moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Slavery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How have you taught the French to underſtand our Coaſts, and way of fighting, and building Ships? Your Brother and you furniſhed them with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Builders, and Models of our Ships; nay, you permitted them to rob and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, to beat and murder our Seamen, and never would ſeek Redreſs: How could you expect the Dominion of the Seas upon theſe Terms?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Was it not your Brother's Deſign to debauch the Nation? And did you not place in the Fleet ſuch Commanders as debauched our Seamen? by which means in a great meaſure they loſt their old brave Engliſh Courage. When our Seamen grow Effeminate, and loſe that Courage which with God's Bleſſing made them victorious, <hi>England</hi> is but in a lamentable Condition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You puniſhed, or at leaſt diſcountenanced ſuch Officers as ſtood for the Honour of the Flag. How often did the French refuſe it? And when ſome Broad-ſides were exchanged, and the French came off by the Lee, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador uſed to complain, and the Captain was ſeverely check'd, if not turned out: For you were converted to ſuch a Degree of Zeal to the French King, that we muſt loſe the Dominion of the Seas, rather than the Holy Alliance with that Monſter ſhould in the leaſt be intrenched; and in the Private League your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made with that King, the Buſineſs of the Flag was not mentioned; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100711:9"/>
how indifferent your Brother and you were in the Caſe when it was in relation to the French, is not yet forgotten.</p>

               <p>YOU ſtand charged with refuſing the Teſt that was provided by Parliament, and paſſed (tho very unwillingly) by your Brother to prevent Popery. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we could not but laugh in our Sleeves when we ſaw your ſelf with a ſort of Iriſh Magnanimity quit your great Imployments for a Religion that makes Men Fools, and renders them as the Sport of the Age: But great Examples go a great way in ſuch Caſes. When the Popiſh Party ſaw your Reſolution to quit all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than your Religion, (ſcarce worth the keeping) ſeveral of them took up the Croſs, and quitted their Imployments alſo, rather than be falſe to your Cauſe and Intereſt: They did not do as your Brother did, retain the Popiſh Religion, and yet ever and anon (to get a little Money of the Parliament) was content to paſs a Bill, or emit a Proclamation or two to the Prejudice of that Religion his Soul was moſt affected with, if with any. Alas good Man, he was for ſecuring the main Chance: If he had not complied for a little Money, the Noble Fleet at <hi>Whitehall</hi> muſt have lain by the Walls without rigging, to the great Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old Trade of Whoring: But as for your part, you were reſolved to give up your ſelf to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the French King, which you could not have done if you had ſwallowed the Teſt. Therefore as a great piece of Self-denial, away go all Imployments, by which you had ruined the Nation; for you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd not but to carry on your Conſpiracy againſt the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, by the help of your good and loving Brother, notwithſtanding your acquittal of them. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You engaged the French King to a cloſer Friendſhip with you, by which you were ſure, not only of his Intereſt, but his Purſe, to aſſiſt you againſt your Enemies and his, even that Parliament that advanced this new State-Purgatory in oppoſition to you and your curſed Villains, by which they had declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the French King's and your mortal Enemies, who both of you drove on ſo furiouſly to have that Parliament diſſolved, in revenge for their laying ſuch a Stumbling-block in the way of your Self and Party: For as long as theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory-makers were in being, it was ſcarce poſſible for you to ſubdue the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Hereſy, that had ſo long domineer'd in the World: And he and you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that Method to be put into ſuch a Condition as ſhould enable you to give the Proteſtant Religion ſuch a Blow as it had not received ſince its firſt Birth; and to give you your due, your Deſign of ruining the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not ill laid; and had you not over-done, your Deſign would not have been ſo ſoon undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By your not taking the Teſt, you engaged a Party of Caſe-hardned Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to eſpouſe your Cauſe and Intereſt; and for true proof of their Integrity, they entered with you into a ſtrict Conſpiracy againſt our Religion, Laws and Liberties: For ſeeing they had met with ſuch a terrible Blow from that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were reſolved to try what they could recover by way of Repriſal from the Dutch, and hoped ſome good would come of continuing the War with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100711:10"/>
them; but finding themſelves defeated there, you and they reſolved, with the gracious Conſent of your Brother, that <hi>England</hi> it ſelf rather than fail ſhould be made a Repriſal: Which Deſign proſpered ſo well upon your Hands, that you went on as merrily as might be in your Plous Work; and accordingly expoſed the Nation to the Fury of the French: And had old <hi>Clifford</hi> had the Grace not to have hang'd himſelf, he would have appeared a very deſerving Perſon, and eminent in that Holy Confederacy. However, you did not fail of your Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in ſome meaſure of ruining the Nation, becauſe of the Proteſtant Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that was found out for its Service, tho you could not find ſuch a one in all your Romiſh Library.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Example you engaged a great number of Prieſts and Jeſuits to infeſt the Kingdom, in order to ſtorm the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and would have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed her, poor Gentlewoman, had ſhe not held up her Smock to ſave them the trouble; and theſe Varlots, with the Argument of your Stedfaſtneſs to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, perverted very many of the lewder ſort of People, both Male and Female: And ſeeing ſuch a Number brought into your Ark, you uſed to ſay, you doubted not of an Army of Roman Catholicks to eſtabliſh the Popiſh Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You made theſe Villains thus perverted ſo bold and daring, that they drove on with ſuch Fury, as it was ſcarce poſſible for a Proteſtant, that was any ways known to be zealous for his Religion, and for the Intereſt of his Country, to walk near <hi>Whitehall</hi> or <hi>St. James</hi>'s, without the danger at leaſt of being affronted or beaten: Whence it was that even that Purgatory-making Parliament thought they had not done enough to expel that Religion, (whoſe Profeſſors in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſtuck at nothing to eſtabliſh their Superſtition, and to that End have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Peace of the Chriſtian World; and had at that time, by your eſpouſing their Cauſe, ſufficiently ſtrengthned, as was feared, their villanous Party to the overthrow of the Proteſtant Intereſt) but reſolved to uſe farther means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Practices of theſe Raſcals that were ſo notoriouſly wicked as not any longer to be born.</p>
               <p>One would have thought this Purgatory-Act ſhould have done the Buſineſs, yet it was backt with a multitude of Gracious Aſſurances to the Nation from your Brother (a Perſon of great Integrity and Honour in his Promiſes) to maintain and defend the Proteſtant Religion; for a Teſtimony whereof obſerve and remember that the Cliffordian and French Deſigns were carried on (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Teſt-Act) in 1673, 74, 75, 76, 77, and part of 78, in as perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, tho different manner from your firſt Deſign, whoſe Method you were forc'd to change by reaſon of that Act, which was ſo made as to execute it ſelf. And the Means of introducing that Religion ſeeming then at a ſtand, you thought of a new Project, that in all probability might not attract that Envy that the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Papiſts in ſeveral great Places of Truſt had done, yet that the ſame Ends might be more certainly and eaſily, tho not ſo ſoon obtained. Which brings me to</p>

               <p>IN order to ſtrengthen the Popiſh and French Intereſt, you were pleaſed to take to Wife the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> whom you have and hold to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100711:10"/>
this Day, which was in it ſelf a Scoundrel Match; but that it might appear ſomewhat conſiderable, the French King declared her an adopted Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and promiſed to give her a Portion ſutable thereunto, for her Father could not give her a Groat: And whether he gave her a Portion or no at that time, I cannot tell; if he did not, I ſuppoſe you will eat it out before you leave <hi>St. Germains.</hi> Your Brother conſented to the Match, without much difficulty, by a good Lord, a Friend of yours, who conſummated the Marriage by the Royal Conſent and Authority of your Brother, <hi>according to the Form uſed amongſt Princes,</hi> as your good Proteſtant Brother was pleaſed to expreſs it.</p>
               <p>Before this precious Bit of Italian Fleſh could arrive in <hi>England,</hi> your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators who adviſed this Marriage, perceived that the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> would come, and that it might probably receive ſome Obſtruction from the Parliament, and that ſome other things were prepared againſt their meeting for the curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Rogues, who were grown (as obſerved to you in the Firſt Part) dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably Inſolent; for the Check the Teſt-Bill had given, was far leſs than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from this wicked Marriage: And that a fatal Blow might be given to the Preparations of the then Houſe of Commons in prejudice of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, you procured a Prorogation to the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1673, whereby to put an End to that Seſſion, and all the Buſineſs unperfected in <hi>March</hi> 1671/3 ſhould fall to the Ground. But pray what was the Matter? Why muſt ſome good Bills fall to the Ground that were ſo well prepared in <hi>March</hi> 1672/3? Why truly your Reaſons for the Prorogation, if I am not much out, were theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To prevent and remove from your Brother all Temptations to break the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Marriage, and the French Alliance, the Parliament being like to uſe their utmoſt endeavour to hinder the Conſummation of that Marriage, which might render the Popiſh Religion and the French Alliance impregnable. You know, <hi>Sir,</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> promoted the Match to ſerve the Catholicks, and the Catholick Religion was your end too, ſince you were converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal, that <hi>Coleman</hi> your Secretary knew not his Head from his Heels, or whether he was awake, or in a Dream: and then to ſtrengthen the Intereſt of the French King muſt be your deſign, ſince his Intereſt and yours were ſo inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united, that he that was your Enemy, was an Enemy to his Intereſt; and he that was an Enemy to his, was to your Intereſt alſo. Now what a wicked Parliament was it that would have ſeparated ſuch an Intereſt, and oppoſe ſuch a Religion, in endeavouring to prevent ſo hopeful a Match, whereby, 1. The Folly; 2. The Malice of you and your Party did appear?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Folly of your Party did appear, for that Parliament did never fail to give Money whenever called for, if they were but indifferently well uſed; and the King was generally unwilling to let a Seſſion go off without ſome Pocket-money for the modeſt Gentlewomen at <hi>Whitehall:</hi> therefore your Partiſans ſhould rather have adjourned the Marriage, than prorogued the Parliament, who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Conſpiracy, (which you had managed more like an Iriſh Teague than an Engliſh Stateſman) were very angry at the King's breach of his Word and Royal Promiſe made to them in <hi>March</hi> before: Therefore notwithſtanding the King's Speech, <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. for a ſwinging Supply for carrying on the War againſt the Dutch, the Parliament would vote nothing but an Addreſs againſt this Match
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100711:11"/>
of yours with the Daughter of <hi>Modena;</hi> for they conſidered the Nation was not able always to lie under the diſpenſation of parting with Money, to ſecure the Popiſh Religion, and French Intereſt: And as a preparation to the Addreſs, you know they paſſed this Vote, <hi>viz. This Houſe taking into conſideration the Condition of the Nation, will not take into any further Debate or Conſideration any Aid, Supply, or Charge upon the Subject, before the time of the Payment of the eighteen Months Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, granted by a late Act of Parliament, intituled,</hi> An Act for raiſing the Sum of 1238750 <hi>l.</hi> for the Supply of his Majeſty's preſent Occaſions, <hi>be expired, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhall appear that the obſtinacy of the Dutch ſhall render it neceſſary; nor before this Kingdom be effectually ſecured from the Danger of Popery, and Popiſh Counſels and Counſellors, and other preſent Grievances be redreſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You having by your little Vermine given out with all Folly and Impudence, that you ſtood in no need of a Parliament but to give Money; by this Vote they were even with you, who with your Crew were ſo nettled at their Vote, that you were reſolved to give them a remove from your Councils: but that it might not ſeem altogether upon the account of denying Money, you let the Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and the Addreſs was prepared with Reaſons againſt this Match of yours, which I have laid down in my firſt Part, and therefore wave them now; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being aſſured that this Marriage at that time was not ſo far concluded, but that for Reaſons of State it might be rejected, as has been practiſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations, and even by the French themſelves in ſeveral Examples, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears in the French Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>I having an Opportunity of diſcourſing about the Match, the Jeſuits condemned the Conduct of your Friends at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, in deferring it till the Seſſion was ſo nigh, and then putting the Parliament off; whereas the Marriage ought rather to have been ſuſpended till the Parliament had given Money; and one Million well husbanded, would have enabled your Brother to ſet up Arbitrary Power, for the French King would have ſtood by him: And further, That your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors had been too open in the ſteps they took in this Match, and had too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly boaſted of the Advantage they ſhould have by it, both as to <hi>France</hi> and Religion, and had too much undervalued the Parliament, ſince you could not at that Time ſubſiſt without one.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As your Party ſhewed their Folly, ſo their Malice; for as the King was unwilling to part without Money, and alſo to quit the French Intereſt, all the Grievances of the Nation muſt be poſtpon'd, which were judged by you to be but Trifles; if any difference did ariſe, it was their Faults to inſiſt on ſuch ſmall things: therefore with Indignation you procured them to be prorogued, that they might recollect themſelves, and baſely comply with your wicked Deſigns of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Dutch, and advancing the Fr. Intereſt in this Match, that they might for the future be of no uſe to you; for a moderate Sum of Money, a Million or two, would, by the French King's Aſſiſtance, have been a competent Stock to open Shop withal, that our Laws, Liberties and Religion too, ſhould have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at one ſtroke, ſuch was your Rage againſt us at that Day. Your Bullies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town had the aid of your Purſe to ſwagger againſt the Parliament, and to admire the French King, and tell us how happy we were by being imbarked in the French Intereſt thrô this Match; and why ſhould a damn'd Parliament
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100711:11"/>
be ſuffered to ſit till it was conſummated beyond the Power of their interpoſing in it? And the King was not to be truſted in this Affair, if a Parliament were to ſit, for he would be wheedled by the Houſe of Commons, upon the account of Money, to break off this hopeful Match, yea, and with the King of <hi>France</hi> too; but keep him without a Parliament, and he would do any thing to pleaſe the French King or your ſelf. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> from all this we may conclude how fooliſh and malicious your Crew did ſhew themſelves in the Prorogation of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that the King might not be engaged by them to break off that Match to the projudice of the Popiſh Religion, or the French Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was not the only Reaſon, for you had another before you, <hi>viz.</hi> The conſideration that the Bill for eaſe of Proteſtant Diſſenters (whereby a major part of them ſhould have Liberty of Conſcience, and be capable of Church-preferment) had paſſed the Commons, and was ſent up to the Lords in <hi>March</hi> 1672/3, where it then remained, and would not long ſtick, as you and your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feared, before it would obtain the Royal Aſſent; which if once effected, you foreſaw the uniting the Proteſtant Intereſt would tend greatly to the ſuppreſſion of Popery, and conſequently no hopes of that Religion's being replanted here: but if you could any how prevent the paſſing that Bill, you doubted not for all the Parliament could do, to be ſafe amongſt ſo many Diſſenters, and drive on your Deſigns underhand for the deſtruction of all Proteſtants. From hence, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That this was a time when you and your Party were not for Liberty of Conſcience, becauſe the uniting of Proteſtants by Liberty would be very fatal to you, and therefore you got the Parliament prorogued, that this Bleſſing might not fall upon you and your Friends. But how comes it to paſs that you <hi>gave God thanks that it was always your Judgment that all Men ought to have the Liberty of their Conſciences in Matters of Religion and Worſhip?</hi> Were not you a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Hypocrite to ſay ſo?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) You muſt needs be engaged in a moſt Helliſh Deſign againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and your Party be reſolved to proceed-no farther in any other Work, but that muſt be deſtroyed, or elſe what needed ſo much Care for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing the Parliament, that the Bill for Liberty of Conſcience, then in the Houſe of Lords, might of courſe come to nothing? By which Prorogation you ſo offended the Parliament, that you loſt at leaſt the Gift of a Million of Money.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It argued you certainly very full of Revenge, that becauſe your Brother was forced to break his Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Prorogation of a Parliament to break the Bill for it, tho it was more legal and commendable in the Parliament, (notwithſtanding the Loggerheaded Reaſons given againſt it in 1664, in a Seſſion of the ſame Parliament) for by it we ſaw plainly that an Arbitrary Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience was the Senſe of your Soul, but a legal Liberty of Conſcience you hated from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Heart, and would rather incur the Diſpleaſure of a Parliament, than they ſhould have the doing of that which they would not ſuffer your Brother, your Self and wicked Party to do in a moſt illegal manner, without the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) I perceive at that time it was the Senſe of the Lords, as well as of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100711:12"/>
that ſuch a Bill was neceſſary to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, and therefore it would have paſſed that Houſe, and the King have given his Royal Aſſent to it, if there had been but a Million or 1200000 Pounds in the Caſe: Therefore that they might be better informed concerning the Conveniency of your Italian Match, and the Inconveniency of that Bill for Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you obtained a Prorogation, tho your Brother, good Man, loſt a ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tax by the Bargain.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) That you gained your Point in reference to Liberty of Conſcience; for Time you know is often Life to a Cauſe: And as the Proteſtant Intereſt run high in the Seſſion of Parliament in 1672/3, and this Act came from the Commons to the Lords in favour of them, who had paſſed it but for want of Time, and another Bill paſſed againſt Popery by which <hi>Clifford</hi> fell, and you and your Party put out of Humour; ſo that <hi>Clifford</hi>'s Fall might be gentle, an end was put to that Seſſion, the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience was broke or cancell'd; and in revenge you put a ſtop to the paſſing the Bill that would have eſtabliſhed Liberty of Conſcience by a Law, by breaking up the Parliament from <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. to 27. and then to <hi>Jan.</hi> 7. following. In this Receſs you not only compleated the Italian Deſign, but ſo ordered the Matter, that when the Parliament met in <hi>January,</hi> all Favour to Diſſenters was killed as dead as a Door-nail, and not one word of reviving the Bill for Liberty of Conſcience was heard of; but on the contrary our Prickear'd Prieſts were inſtructed to preach this to be as true as the Goſpel, that now there was no more Danger from the Papiſts, but that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks were the only dangerous Enemy; and you and the Devil's Brokers had found out a Scots Lord, and 2 Men who then made a mighty Figure at Court, that were impudent and deſperate enough to put the King's Affairs on ſo narrow and weak a Bottom: Nay, Old <hi>Lawderdale,</hi> rather than fail, becomes a Patron of the Church; and who but he with his Guts was cried up by our Paraſitical Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-hunters? Nay, I will ſay this for <hi>Clifford,</hi> that tho Villain enough, yet his Principles were very generous in compariſon of your new Set of Juglers, whoſe Buſineſs it was to ruin thoſe this Year they had ſupported but the laſt; nay, give them their due, they would never forgive a Man that had been but once in the Right. Thoſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> were your truſty Cards, and they agreed with our Spiritual Guides, and <hi>Roger</hi> their Maſter, not only in Principles, but Paſſion too; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you preſently joined with them in directing the Judges to put the Laws in Execution againſt Diſſenters; which was done as you required.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Our Holy Church-men, as their Zeal was much increaſed by your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to ſuppreſs the Diſſenters, ſo their Zeal againſt Popery was to all Intents and Purpoſes extinguiſh'd, as if you and your Italian Miſtreſs had been naturally dead: For if any of the young Fry had preached againſt it, he was rebuked as too Pragmatical and Sawcy; and truly ſo they were that preſum'd to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Religion your Brother and you had ventur'd Soul and Body to advance, in order to pox the whole Nation, both Men and Women: for the French Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eaſe was ſo Epidemical, that a Man could ſcarce find fair Quarter, no not in the-Church or Chancel, unleſs he was of the French Intereſt. Thus you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Succeſs attended your Deſign in proroguing the Parliament, by which the Liberty of Conſcience intended was defeated, and how its Defeat,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100711:12"/>
with the Conſequences thereof, proſpered upon your Hands. But what ſignifies all this, ſince there was a French Intereſt, the Romiſh Religion, and an Italian Comrade to ſupport all? So much for your ſecond Reaſon for proroguing that Parliament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Your great Deſign in carrying on this Match by the Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, was to create a Jealouſy between the King and them, exaſperating him with their Impertinency; and by your prevailing with him to countenance that wicked Match, you exaſperated the Parliament againſt the King: For tho that Parliament ſhould for ever after that Match have denied to give Money, yet you were ſo ſure of the French King, that you hoped by the help of his Forces to have brought Popery in upon us, and with it Arbitrary Government; the firſt of which your Popiſh Tools cried up as the beſt Religion, and our High Church-Rogues in conjunction with them, cried up the laſt as the beſt of Governments; yet at the ſame time they would deny it to be practicable here, unleſs it pleaſed God to find out ſome way for both theſe great Churches to unite together to ſuppreſs Phanaticiſm. But the Parliament ſaw into your Game, and obſerved your Steps: You ſunk much in their Opinion, therefore you reſolv'd they ſhould ſink in the King's Opinion, which occaſioned ſo many Prorogations when you and your Party had any Villany in hand. I might have ſaid more to this Point, but that I have ſpoken to it in my Firſt Part.</p>

               <p>YOUR Brother and you made a French-Man General of your Army, to the great Diſhonour of the Engliſh Nobility. This French General was then Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and one of the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and he was choſen to bear that Truſt before many valuable Noblemen we had at that Day. It's true, he was a great Souldier, and worthy to have commanded a better Army than you had at <hi>Black-Heath;</hi> but when he ſaw what Vermin you and your Crew had got together, and that their Deſign was to plunder the City of <hi>London,</hi> and not to fight againſt the Dutch, he fairly quitted his Poſt, and left you; tho, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is not to be forgotten what Deſigns you would have engaged that Noble Perſon in, for you propoſed to your ſelf and Friends that he being a French Man, would have joined with you in the Deſign of Arbitrary Government; but when the thing was put to him, he abhorred it, and would not therefore continue in the Command.</p>
               <p>But what a Diſhonour was this to the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> that not one of them could be found to take upon him ſuch a Command? 1. Were they ſuch Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards that they dare not undertake it? Or, 2. Were they ſo unskilful in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, that they could not with Honour do it? Or, 3. Was the Deſign ſo villanous, that they were not to underſtand any part of it? Were you-reſolved upon the French Government? Then <hi>Schomberg</hi> you judged would join with you in that Affair: Or were you reſolved that Popery ſhould proceed? Then you had the Judicious Major General <hi>Fitzgerald</hi> that was to have done it. I believe, <hi>Sir,</hi> you deſpaired of any of our Noblemen joining with you in theſe two Parts of your Deſign, Popery and Arbitrary Power, and therefore ſought for other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that might give better hopes of approving themſelves fit for your turn;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100711:13"/>
which turned to an ill Accompt, for it bred ill Blood in the Nobility againſt you and your villanous Party.</p>

               <p>YOUR Brother and you oppreſſed the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in order to ruin the Proteſtant Intereſt there. Be pleaſed, <hi>Sir,</hi> to call to mind that when in the Year 1660 it pleaſed God to reſtore your Brother to the Throne in that Antient Kingdom, the news of it was grateful to that People, hoping his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration would prove a great Bleſſing and Comfort to them; and he had been ſo, if you and your wicked Party had let him taken ſuch Meaſures as would have ſettled that Kingdom in Peace and Quietneſs. There are ſeveral Particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that Kingdom worthy your Conſideration; and ſuppoſing you may by Mrs. <hi>Abigail</hi>'s leave have now ſome time of thinking, I pray remember,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon your Brother's Reſtoration, notwithſtanding the Troubles and hard Uſage the Scots had met with from your Father, (which coſt him his Life at long-run) and from <hi>Monk</hi> who for ſeveral Years had acted the part of a Tyrant in his Government of that Kingdom, yet they took no advantage of theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, but with all chearfulneſs put their Necks under your Brother's Yoke of Abſolute Prerogative, of chuſing all Officers of State, Counſellors and Judges, in making War and Peace, and calling and diſſolving Parliaments and Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State. It is well known how they had been provoked to renounce your Father's Government, and put themſelves under the Protection of ſome other Prince, and might have defeated your Brother's Pretenſions to that Kingdom, ſince he renounced the Covenant he ſwore to maintain: But they forgot all this, and gladly received him their King, and for Peace ſake parted with many Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which that Kingdom antiently had, hoping thereby to have engaged him to be a Nurſing Father to their Church, as then conſtituted according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Reformers, and (as they judged) to the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You cannot but remember that this was not the only Demonſtration of the great Loyalty of that People: For tho it is well known that a limited Power in the Prince, and the ſupport of it by the Peoples Purſe, was the juſt Ballance of the Government of that and all other Kingdoms; yet forgetting all Differences in your Father's Reign, they teſtified an affectionate Zeal to your Brother, in making the Revenue above double what your Father or he poſſeſſed; and had they given themſelves up to an intire Vaſſalage, he could ſcarce have deſired ſuch a Bounty; nay he thought it ſuch a piece of exuberant Liberality, that he was pleaſed to declare it was enough, and that he would have no more: Yet the Commiſſioners that held the Parliaments, (notwithſtanding the King was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the greatneſs of their Benevolence) have drawn forth ſeveral Taxes, (pretending the King's great Neceſſities) even beyond the Ability of that People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They alſo complied with the deſire of your Brother (by your procurement) to ſubmit to the Bondage and Slavery of a villanous ſtanding Army, which they called in an Act that raiſed it, <hi>An humble Tender to his Sacred Majeſty, of the Duty and Loyalty of his antient Kingdom of</hi> Scotland: And as a Teſtimony of the ſame, they did offer to the King 20000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe ſufficiently armed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100711:13"/>
with 40 days Proviſion, to be ready upon the King's call; and in the ſame Act they declared, that if the King ſhould have farther Uſe and Occaſion for their Service, the Kingdom would be ready every Man between Sixty and Sixteen, and hazard their Lives and Fortunes, if called for by his Majeſty, for the Safety and Preſervation of his Perſon, Authority, and Government. Sure one would think you had given them ſome State Philtre, to create in them ſuch a ſlaviſh Loyalty and Love to your Brother's Perſon and Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nay they went a ſtep farther to pleaſe your Brother and your ſelf, being reſolved not to fall ſhort in expreſſing their Loyalty and Affection to him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do but obſerve them in another Act of Parliament, wherein they moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and humbly recognize his Majeſty's Prerogative Royal, and declar'd in the ſaid Act, That <hi>the ordering and diſpoſal of Trade with Foreign Nations, and the laying Reſtraints and Impoſitions upon Foreign Imported Commodities, did belong to his Majeſty and his Succeſſors, as an undoubted Privilege and Prerogative of the Crown, and that therefore they might do therein as they ſhould judg fit for the good of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe People certainly were bewitch'd with the thing called <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and made it appear to the World that they placed the Security of all their Intereſts more in their Confidence of the King's Goodneſs, than the firmeſt Proviſion of the beſt Laws: for tho in the Parliament held by your Father in Perſon, in 1641, many Acts were ſigned by him for ſettling their Religion, Properties, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which the deepeſt Conſideration and Maturity of Judgment imaginable, grounded upon long and well-weighed Experience, many and well-managed Treaties, and the Mediation of <hi>England,</hi> could afford and furniſh; yet becauſe the Glory of thoſe Laws appeared to theſe Blockheads to be ſtain'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſome previous Contentions, wherein they thought themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infortunate, by having your Father differ from them, to pleaſe your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at one blow they repealed the whole Proceeding of that Parliament, and all the Laws then and there made for the Preſervation of Religion as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thoſe whom God will deſtroy he delivers up to Madneſs firſt, and ſ he did theſe People, in evidencing an unparallel'd Submiſſion to the King, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of all that was near and dear to them into his Hands: for tho that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince its firſt Reformation from Popery, did continually oppoſe Prelacy, yet after they had deſtroyed it, and enjoyed their Church under a Conſtitution and Miniſtry according to their Hearts deſire, in compliance with your Brother, they parted with the Presbyterian Government, and reeſtabliſhed Epiſcopacy, to the Amazement of moſt Men; ſo acceptable was he to the Scots Parliament at that Time. And for the carrying on your curſed Deſigns, you know how your Brother made <hi>James Sharp,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farwell,</hi> and another whoſe Name occurs not at preſent, to renounce their Presbyterian Ordination, who were made Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Prieſts, and then conſecrated Biſhops by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and two others of that Gang: and four Scots Prelates thus made, the King fixed the Government of that Church by Arch-biſhops and Biſhops, as in his Father's time in 1637, who had the ſame Authority derived to them as they had in your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's Reign: ſo by Proclamation bearing date <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. 1661. the Presbyterian Government ceaſed to be to all Intents and Purpoſes; and the Council ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meeting of the Presbyteries till they had received Power, not from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100711:14"/>
but from the Arch-biſhops and Biſhops, who were in a ſhort Time to enter upon their Government. To compleat this Work, the Parliament in the <hi>2d</hi> Seſſion reinſtated the Biſhops in the exerciſe of their Functions, and reſtored them to all their Privileges, Dignities, Poſſeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now one would think this Compliance of the Nation ſhould have obliged your Brother and you to have treated them in ſome meaſure ſutable to their Loyalty and ſlaviſh Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Your great Inſtrument in carrying on this bleſſed Work of inſlaving the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in theſe particulars, in order to your farther Deſigns, was the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> the firſt High Commiſſioner after your Brother's return, who was moſt violent in purſuing this Change: but by his impetuous Violence in this mighty Work, (on which he much valued himſelf) he rendered himſelf obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious; and deſpiſing <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who took hold of ſome of his Miſcarriages, in a ſhort Time he was unhorſed by him; and <hi>Lauderdale</hi> procured the Commiſſion of Lord High Commiſſioner for the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> by whom <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was diſſolved; upon which Madam <hi>Van Harlot,</hi> their new Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in its proper Colours, and being made Triumphant, 'tis well known what Pranks the Whore played, what Tumults her Guides excited, and what Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies her Reverend Clergy acted in your Brother's Reign. Nay, old <hi>Hodg</hi> was not ſo much as adviſed withal in the Caſe; and every thing was carried on with that Fury, that had not Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> come in to the Relief of the People, who were on the very brink of Deſtruction, they muſt have inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I will not dwell here any longer, only tell you that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was the third Lord High Commiſſioner of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by whom a lamentable Scene of Rogueries were acted, and by whom you made your bleſſed Steps to ruin that poor Nation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your firſt Step to ruin <hi>Scotland,</hi> was the making <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale</hi> ſo exceſſively great. In truth, to give the Beaſts their due, as the Scotiſh Nation was not able to bear their Greatneſs, ſo neither they to bear their own. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that before <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was Commiſſioner, by reaſon of his being ſole Secretary of State for that Nation, and Court-miniſter, he had the abſolute Rule and diſpoſing of the Affairs and Concerns of that Kingdom, which gave great Offence to the Scots, who in the particulars aboveſaid had ſhewed themſelves ſo abominably Loyal as to quit their Religion, Laws, and Liberties, to pleaſe your Brother and you. As for <hi>Middleton,</hi> he was inveſted with ſuch Powers, that <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi> was jealous of his Greatneſs, who ſeeing him exerciſe his Power to the utmoſt, imagined there would be nothing for him to do, and therefore (as I ſaid) juſtled <hi>Middleton</hi> out; by whoſe Greatneſs <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Conſent of Parliament, delivered up all, as if <hi>Hallifax</hi> himſelf had iſſued forth <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> againſt their Franchiſes, both as to Liberty and Religion: and you having had enough of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s proſtituting himſelf to your Brother's Will and yours, <hi>exit Middleton,</hi> and enter <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> a caſe-hardened Rogue, a Villain fit for the Devil's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to all Intents and Purpoſes; who the more eaſily to compleat your wicked Deſigns, you may remember did baſely debar his Countrey-men from ſpeaking with the King otherwiſe than he pleaſed, for fear they might tell Tales of his exorbitant Power, by which he diſobliged them in the higheſt; and by reaſon of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100711:14"/>
his being moſtly here at Court, the Scots Noblemen and Gentlemen were ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to a baſe and vile dependance upon his Creatures and Favourites, nay often-times upon his Servants, with whom it's well known they tranſacted for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and diſpatching Gifts, and Sign-manuals, and that it was by the ſaid <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Servants that Protections to Debtors were ſo villanouſly obtained.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, <hi>Sir,</hi> to put you in mind how hurtful he was to the Nation as High Commiſſioner of that Kingdom; in order to which we may note, that the Office of High Commiſſioner is altogether extraordinary, and for a particular Occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> The holding of a Parliament in the King's Abſence, therefore ſcarce known in <hi>Scotland</hi> till <hi>James</hi> I. came to the Crown; and when the Seſſion of Parliament was upon its determination, that Office alſo determined with it. Now when you had made <hi>Middleton</hi> ſo great, he brought in that Innovation of adjourning Parliaments for a long time, that he might tamper with them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the People; whereby he moſt illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued his Commiſſion in the Interval of Parliament, ſo that he might fit and prepare that poor People for Deſtruction. Truly he had gone a pretty way in it; and that he might finiſh his Work, and ſerve your Purpoſes upon that Kingdom, he did (as I ſaid) lengthen the Adjournment of that Parliament for about two Years or ſo, a thing never before known in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for which, <hi>Sir,</hi> your old Bandog <hi>Lauderdale</hi> accuſed him as a Criminal to the King and you, with the reproachful Title of <hi>a Subverter of the Government:</hi> But however, the Matter was huſh'd up, for <hi>Middleton</hi> having done your Buſineſs ſo well there, in time he was rewarded with the Government of <hi>Tangier.</hi> But when <hi>Lauderdale</hi> got into the ſame Station, he far outwent <hi>Middleton</hi> in continuing his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for he ſpun it out for four Years and a half; for which there was no manner of Neceſſity, if you conſider but the State of Affairs then in that Kingdom: Nay, it was ſo far from being neceſſary, that it was a notorious Grievance, for by it he not only hindred the Proceedings of the Parliament, but endeavoured to fruſtrate all its Meetings; which as it was a known Violation of the Antient Conſtitution of that Government, ſo the unneceſſary Continuance, and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long Adjourments of the Parliament, contributed exceedingly to the increaſe of the Peoples Burdens and Diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is plain that the villanous Deportment of that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was ſuch, in the Truſt your Brother and you repoſed in him, which in time appear'd to be his beſt Security: And why ſo? The Reaſon, <hi>Sir,</hi> is plain; for what he had proudly plotted and contrived through his matchleſs Ambition, (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf that he might be reckoned withal for his deviliſh Proceedings in that Station) he was under ſome neceſſity of maintaining by his Power, in a moſt tenacious way, that he might perfect the Ruin of that People, making good the old Proverb, <hi>Over Shoes over Boots,</hi> it would be all one at the Gallows at laſt: So that the Relief of that poor and abandon'd People, from the Diſorders which you and your wicked Party had made in that Kingdom by thoſe two Men, remained only with Almighty God, there being no Hopes from your Brother.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> after the Adjournment of a Parliament, which was held (if I am not miſinformed) in 1674. and adjourned in <hi>December</hi> that Year, Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tweddale,</hi> and ſome Gentlemen (being ſenſible of the notorious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100711:15"/>
Villanies of old <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and to prevent his Lies from taking place with the King) repair to the Court in <hi>England,</hi> with the Approbation of thoſe to whom they communicated their Intentions, being confident they ſhould be delivered from the Oppreſſions occaſioned by <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale;</hi> and hoping the King would receive their faithful Repreſentation of the Affairs of that Nation, both as to Religion and Government. But <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who was an Enemy of all Righteouſneſs and Truth, omitted no Obſtruction he could lay in the way: For, 1. by a Proclamation he procured that no Scots-man ſhould go out of the Kingdom without Licence from the Council, that ſo the King might not have the Truth of Affairs laid before him, whereby to ſee the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that poor People were in, in order to give them ſome Legal Redreſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 2. it is well known he imployed a pitiful Raſcal at <hi>Berwick,</hi> as a Spy to intercept all free Correſpondence; who being impowred by him, did ſeize and ſearch Sir <hi>William Carnegie</hi> a Member of Parliament, and detain'd him (a Lord of his Name you well remember) in his Paſſage thrô that Town to <hi>London.</hi> 3. <hi>Lauderdale</hi> having by means of this Rogue got ſome Packets intercepted, he like a baſe Villain tranſmitted them to our Court, not conſidering the Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done to the common Intercourſe and good Underſtanding of the two Nations, nor regarding that Tenderneſs which honeſt Men have for the Honour of their Country, and obtained of the King for this Fellow for ſuch Rogueries (inſtead of a Pillory or Gallows) the Reward of 50 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> to be paid out of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the great Satisfaction of the King, your Self, and wicked Party. 4. By the ſame Means, and in the ſame Place, he endeavoured to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Company in their Paſſage, by queſtioning their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and refuſing them a Night's lodging; which was not known to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Town, he being abſent: But at the return of theſe Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both Governour and People of the Place teſtified their Reſpects to them. 5. This <hi>Lauderdale</hi> incenſed the King and you againſt a Gentleman Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſent before him, as one that had been a Sequeſtrator in the Time of <hi>Oliver,</hi> (ſometime Lord-Protector of theſe three Nations) and a Perſon diſaffected to the Government: But notwithſtanding all theſe Obſtacles, and many other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, the ſame Perſons arrived at Court, and did with all Submiſſion and Sincerity, and in all Faithfulneſs and Truth, acquit themſelves, giving a full Account of the State of Affairs both as to the King's and Countrey's Intereſt. What was the Event of all this? Truly they were diſmiſſed with fair Words, and had poſitive Promiſes that the Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould meet and ſit an the Day appointed, that Grievances ſhould be redreſſed, and that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Lauderdale</hi> held as Commiſſioner ſhould be revoked. Upon which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten home, (the Duke with extraordinary Difficulty, both in reſpect of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Seaſon, and his weakneſs of Body) that they might attend the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in their reſpective Places on the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to which Time the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adjourned, which was the very next Day after their arrival.

Upon this I pray remember the Carriages of this notorious State-Villain, by which you might ſee the Nature of the Beaſt, that you your ſelf at laſt hated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Call to mind, that to pleaſe you and your Villanous Party, he did in the moſt inſolent manner undervalue Parliaments, which he diſcovered by that raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Expreſſion to the King againſt the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> leſſening what he had done, as if he had not been ſerviceable enough to <hi>Baal; Sir, if you had ſent down a Dog with your Commiſſion about his Neck to your Scots Parliament, he would have done all the Earl of</hi> Middleton <hi>had done;</hi> who one would have thought had been Villain enough for doing what he did in the Innovations he brought into <hi>Scotland,</hi> both in Church and State: But it ſeems, <hi>Sir,</hi> you found <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to be a Rogue of a deeper Die, and therefore <hi>Middleton</hi> was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and <hi>Covenant-Lauderdale</hi> made uſe of to carry on Deſigns more wicked than ever <hi>Middleton</hi> was acquainted withal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Call to mind how he treated ſome of the Scots Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with moſt unſufferable Inſolence; for truly had he done as much by me, I ſhould, upon Conſideration of his other Vertues, have done his Country and my own that Service that two Parliaments by the Means of your Power could not do. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> to return to our Scots Parliament-men, he ſent one to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Name was Mr. <hi>William Moor,</hi> becauſe he deſired (after the Order of the Engliſh Parliament) their Acts might be at leaſt thrice read before they were voted, or ſomewhat to that purpoſe; and uſing the word <hi>We</hi> for <hi>I,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> to him, <hi>What, are there any more in your Arſe?</hi> Which baſe ſpeaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked moſt of the Members as very indecent and unmannerly, and not to be uſed to Gentlemen. I will ſay that for the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> that he underſtood how to uſe a Gentleman, tho bad enough; but this Raſcal, when in Power, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> I ſuppoſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> you have not forgot his-ſlighting Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the moſt contemptible manner, and moſt of the Antient Nobility of the greateſt Intereſt and Value in that Kingdom, whom he did not ſo much as allow to be named among the Commiſſioners choſen for the Treaty of Union betwixt the two Kingdoms, tho many were named that ought not to have been, unleſs in a dead Warrant, which was his deſert for many a fair Year, and you your ſelf thought ſo at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4ly.</hi> After your Brother and you had made him thus great, you may remember how inconſtant this Villain was to thoſe with whom he profeſſed the greateſt Friendſhip; for in the time of his Greatneſs he acted according to his Humour and Advantage, not according to the Meaſures and Rules an honeſt Man ſhould uſe in Converſation with Mankind, witneſs his dealing with the late Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes, Tweddale,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> and others, whom (as it ſerved his Turn) he careſt with all open Flattery, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, when you had given him direction to ſlight and contemn them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly.</hi> To ſerve the wicked Deſigns of you and your Conſpirators, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how he neglected the Intereſt of his Country, and gratified a parcel or beggarly Raſcals that depended on him for Bread, by procuring them Gifts upon the Forfeitures of the Penal Statutes then in Force: As to Sir <hi>John Moncreif</hi> a Gift of the Fines upon thoſe who were convicted for Nonconformity in the

Shires of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Perth;</hi> and to one <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Ardreſs,</hi> and Major <hi>Bothwick,</hi> a Gift upon the Maltmen and Brewers; and to the ſaid <hi>Bothwick</hi> another vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gift commonly called of <hi>Peck and Bole.</hi> Theſe were known Rogues and Spies for him, and were great Perſecutors of the People of God in thoſe Parts: and to one <hi>Carmichel</hi> he gave large Sums to accuſe Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> falſly, ſince a Peer of that Kingdom; this <hi>Carmichel</hi> ſince that died of a languiſhing Diſeaſe in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Priſon, where he confeſſed to me upon his Death-bed his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villanies againſt the People of God in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> Give me leave to put you in mind of his horrid Prophaneneſs; witneſs his Compliment to that Firſt-born of all Villany and Falſneſs the Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> that was executed for his many Villanies, by a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Men that could not have Juſtice done otherwiſe; to whom <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Come in my Lord, ſit down here at my right Hand, and I will make all your Enemies your Footſtool.</hi> This was ſo prophane, that thoſe who heard the Villain utter theſe words, trembled, and were ſo filled with Horror, that one of them was ſick almoſt to death. Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> you your ſelf was pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had an odd way of prophaning the Scriptures, which was not to be endured by a chaſte Ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7ly.</hi> You have heard his raſcally, inſipid, and malicious way of jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing, at and againſt his old Practices and Acquaintance, when the Villain was a Profeſſor of Religion: One Day at his Table he ſaid, He could pray and cant as well as any Nonconformiſt in the Chriſtian World; and to entertain his Company in contempt of the Moſt High, he began a Complaint to God, and in deriſion would confeſs his Covenant-breaking, and other Sins; at which many of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions left him (tho perhaps otherwiſe lewd enough) for fear the Houſe ſhould fall upon them, and they periſh with him for his abominable Wickedneſs. You may remember how he uſed his old Acquaintance that kept their Integrity in Religion, how he inſulted over them when they appeared before him in Council, by a reproachful remembrance of former Practices in religious Duties; ſo that ſome of 'em have uſed the old Proverb concerning him, <hi>No Turk like to a Renegado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> was a fit Tool for you to uſe for introducing your baſe Deſigns of Slavery into that Kingdom, in order to eſtabliſh Popery. Alas, <hi>Middleton</hi> was but an Aſs to this Fellow, for he had ſome Grains of a Gentleman; but this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was the Compound of all Unrighteouſneſs, and an Enemy of God and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: This was the Man you advanced by <hi>Middleton,</hi> and by him and your ſweet ſelf <hi>Scotland</hi> was bravely bridled and ſadled to your Heart's content. Thus I conclude the firſt ſtep you took to the Ruin of that Antient (and your Father's native) Kingdom. Concerning theſe two Men it may be ſaid, that <hi>Middleton</hi> ſerved <hi>Baal</hi> a little, but <hi>Lauderdale</hi> ſerved him much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Step you took to ruin that Kingdom, and your Brother's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was the filling the Courts of Judicature there (eſpecially their Seſſion, which is the Supream Court of Juſtice) with ignorant and inſufficient Men. This, <hi>Sir,</hi> was the Method you purſued, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and therefore I ſhould have much wondered if <hi>Scotland</hi> had eſcaped that Grace and Favour of yours, which was generally ſpeaking pretty impartial: For why ſhould the Adminiſtration of Juſtice be in better Hands there than it was here?

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> as you did here. To prove this, you procured your Brother's Letters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to conſtitute one Sir <hi>Andrew Ramſey</hi> one of the Lords of the Seſſions who never was bred up to the Law, but to Merchandizing: Which extrava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ant Proceeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complained of in Parliament, as of dangerous Conſequence, <hi>Ramſey</hi> parted with his Place, reſigning it up to <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and was ſaid to have more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg than the other three: And by reaſon of the Inſufficiency of the Lords of the Seſſion thereupon, Partiality ſo manifeſtly crept into that, as well as other Courts of Juſtice, that the Foundations of Law and Juſtice were much ſhaken, as was once ready to be proved in full Parliament in that Kingdom in the Time of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Miniſtry. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may ſee it was not a Fault in a Man to ſerve the late Protector, if he would but join with <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and you to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government of that Kingdom, and enſlave the People, in order to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Popery: For this <hi>Ramſey</hi> had been Provoſt of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the Protector's Time, and complied with him to the height of being knighted, and after that got to be reknighted, and reentred Provoſt, by the Favour of Earl <hi>Middleton,</hi> to whom he was a villanous Tool in aſſiſting him to defraud the People of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, all at once: But upon <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Diſgrace, this Fellow ſtrikes in with <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who had a greater Sacrifice to offer to <hi>Baal</hi> than <hi>Middleton</hi> had yet offered, with whom and the Tradeſmen of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by his long-practiſed Arts of Flattery and Bribery, he ſo mightily prevailed, that continuing Provoſt for ten Years, in that time he ſo domineered over the poor Citizens, and ſo enriched himſelf by their Rents and Moneys at his Pleaſure, that by <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Aſſiſtance and yours he cheated the King of near 20000 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> and had an Opportunity of obtaining to be conſtituted one of the Lords of the Seſſion: And tho he with the other three (who, as I ſaid before, were more unskilful in the Law) made ſuch Havock, that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> himſelf could not keep him in that Station, ſo many notorious Corruptions and illegal Proceedings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved againſt him and them, yet there was not a Change made in that Court without ſome difficulty. And after all their ſignal Villanies they were let fall by your ſelf and <hi>Lauderdale</hi> as Men that had overdone your Buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Step taken to ruin the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was the Gift of a Part of your Brother's Revenue, called <hi>the King's Caſualties</hi> (which is the Wards and Marriages) to another of your Creatures there, procured by <hi>Lauderdale</hi> thrô your Intereſt with the King, tho contrary to all the Laws of that Kingdom in that Caſe; which was not only prejudicial to the Government, but extreamly vexatious to the People: For theſe <hi>Caſualties</hi> were an Arbitrary Revenue, and paid or not as the King pleaſed: Therefore the giving it to any one Man to make his moſt of it, was both againſt Law and Reaſon, and the Intereſt of the Subject. This Creature of yours was the Earl of <hi>Kincaerden,</hi> who, the more to oppreſs the People in this Point, was by the King's Letters by you procured, joined in Commiſſion with <hi>Lauderdale</hi> in the Treaſury, and alſo with the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Lords of the Seſſion, by which they went on without controul to grieve the People. <hi>Sir,</hi> It is apparent to thoſe that underſtand the Conſtitution of that Kingdom, that this Gift of the <hi>Caſualties</hi> was never known in <hi>Scotland</hi> till at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted

                  </gap>quency, it proved one Cauſe of his Diſgrace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You know it was your Rogues Deſign here in <hi>England</hi> to diminiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the Coin and Plate of the Kingdom, the direful Effects whereof we feel at this Day, and for which this Nation is bound to curſe the Names and Memory of you and your wicked Adherents. Thus you proceeded in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (tho your Father's own dear Country) where you corrupted the Mint and Coinage: For by the King's Letters the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> (Brother to <hi>Lauderdale)</hi> was conſtituted chief in that Office. I think they call the Maſter of the Mint <hi>General;</hi> but if I am miſtaken in the Names, I may be in ſome meaſure excuſed. But as to the thing I am ſure I am in the right, for the Corruption of the Mint and Coinage was ſo great, that the Scots People grew very uneaſy, and made a fearful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in Parliament, proving in that Auguſt Aſſembly, that for ſeveral Years they had found to their ſorrow the intrinſick Value of the Silver Coin ſenſibly diminiſhed both in Weight and Fineneſs, to the great Damage of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Nay, the thing reſted not here, but to vex the People, care was taken by <hi>Hatton</hi> to over-charge the Country with a ſort of baſe Coin, without conſidering the Weight and Value of that ſort of Money, to the manifeſt hindering of the Trade of that Kingdom; and it was an Artifice your Conſpirators uſed for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving that People, to impoveriſh them, ſo that you might the more eaſily bring them under the Yoke of an Arbitrary Power.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you might help on this Lord of the Mint in depraving the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Coin, you may remember the Dutch Dollars, commonly called <hi>Leg-Dollars,</hi> (uſually imported by their Merchants, and currant with them at 58 <hi>d. per</hi> Piece) were cried down by your Bandog <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to 56 <hi>d.</hi> for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe he procured your Favour to obtain a Command from the King for ſo doing, that the ſaid Dollars might be brought as Bullion into the Mint, for the Advantage of the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> his Brother, and your Favorite. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Complaint of the People, there was nothing done: But upon the Adjournment of the Parliament, a Sham-Trial was obtained, and the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> indemnified, tho it was proved that none of the Money coined in his Time was either Weight or Standard.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Step you took to overturn the Government of that Kingdom, and defraud that People of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, was a certain Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter your Brother and you ſet up, a Body of Villains called <hi>the Lords of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> The moſt valuable and conſidering Men of that Nation (ſome of whom I have had the Honour to be acquainted with) have judged this Body of Men to be nothing elſe but a virtual Subverſion of the Power and Liberties of Parliament, and highly prejudicial to the King and Kingdom. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this meeting of the <hi>Articles,</hi> when reeſtabliſhed by you and your Conſpirators, conſiſted of 8 Biſhops choſen by the Lords, and 8 Lords choſen by the Biſhops, 8 Commiſſioners of the Shires, and 8 Burgeſſes choſen by the 8 Lords and 8 Biſhops: to which the Commiſſioner added the Officers of State.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe who contended for this Body of Men, have aſſerted, that not only all Buſineſs muſt be by the <hi>Lords of the Articles,</hi> and them only, regiſtred in Parliament, but alſo that if in the Debates upon their Reports any new thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100711:17"/>
ſhould be ſtarted, the Parliament ought to take no notice of it further than to return the whole Matter to the meeting of the <hi>Articles,</hi> to be there entertained or ſuppreſſed at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is manifeſt from all the Records of that Antient Kingdom, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Conſtitution of this Meeting, or Body of Men, was at firſt by the free ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of their Parliaments, who thought fit to name certain of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for framing ſuch Overtures as were offered for the Publick Good, into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in order to be turned into Laws, according to the Antient Form: And therefore it being at firſt deviſed by the Parliament as a ſimple Expedient for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſpatch, it was not always uſed, but the Number was changeable, as alſo its Method, according as the Parliament ſaw Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You could not be ſo ignorant but that at one time or other, when you was in that Kingdom, you muſt be informed that as this Body of Men was in effect the Committee of Parliament to prepare and bring in Laws, ſo that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of more antient Date, called <hi>the Committee of Complaints,</hi> or <hi>the Lords of the Grievances,</hi> which was of uſe in all times, and never laid aſide till the ſecond Seſſion of the Parliament called in 1661, in the time of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Act of Parliament of K. <hi>James</hi> your Grandfather, appointing four of every State to meet 20 days before the Parliament, to receive all Articles and Petitions, and deliver them to the Clerk of the Regiſter to be preſented to the Parliament for their Conſideration, that things reaſonable might be formally made and preſented to the Lords of the Articles in Parliament-time, and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Matters rejected, doth no ways countenance that exorbitant Power theſe Lords of the Articles did aſſume to themſelves; it being manifeſt by the Order therein ſet down of preparing Matters by a Meeting before-hand, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent forming and preſenting by the Parliament to theſe Article-men, that the Parliament's Power of firſt receiving, and then committing Matters to that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Men, was not then ſo much as the Subject of the Queſtion: But the only thing intended was the orderly ſetting down of things in Parliament, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the words of that Act of your Grandfather, That <hi>no Article or Petition wanting a ſpecial Title, or unſcribed by him that preſented the ſame, ſhall be read or anſwered in that Convention or Parliament following the ſame:</hi> Which was, <hi>Sir,</hi> a Proviſion ſo clearly preparatory to the Meeting and Buſineſs of the Lords of the Articles, that 'tis very ſtrange your Brother ſhould be ſo impoſed upon by you and your Conſpirators to prove this pretended Meeting had a Prerogative above that of the Parliament; and it has been affirmed by ſeveral Perſons of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that underſtood the Scotiſh Parliament and Conſtitution, that this villanous Authority was never intended by the King or Parliament to be in the Lords of the Articles; nor had they the Impudence to pretend to it till they were counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in that Pretenſion by you and your Conſpirators.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You cannot but remember that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had a great Influence on that Parliament that was called in 1663, when a particular Act paſſed for ſettling the Conſtitution, and chuſing Lords of the Articles for the time to come; in which it was expreſly provided that the Lords of the Articles are to proceed in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Truſt in preparing of Laws, Acts and Propoſals, and ordering all things remitted to them by the Parliament; which words <hi>remitted them</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100711:18"/>
no more nor leſs than that the Power of propoſing was in the Body of the Parliament, and that the Lords of the Articles were to act upon the things referred to them by Parliament, as a Committee of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Theſe Lords of the Articles were but the Parliament's Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Servants; and therefore how could they determine the Points the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was to debate, or not, as they ſhould ſee fit? Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but a little of this Matter, you will find that your Fellow-Conſpirator, by attributing ſo much to theſe Lords of the Articles of Power and Prehemince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Parliament, deſign'd in time to deſtroy the Uſe of Parliaments: For what was the Liberty, Authority and Dignity of a Parliament, if thus trampled on by theſe Miſcreants, who were by this Inſolency become a great Grievance to the Kingdom?</p>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I cannot but think that this Conſpirator <hi>Lauderdale</hi> by his many Villanies, had put himſelf under ſome Neceſſity of thoſe Men, and was prompted by ſome cogent Reaſons to promote that exuberant Power in them. For, 1. I ſuppoſe he could not but be filled with the Terror of the Guilt he contracted thrô his wicked Proceedings, and therefore might rationally ſuppoſe theſe Men (thrô the baſe Compliance of the wicked Biſhops) would be a Refuge to him, as they always were to Rogues and Traitors in that Kingdom: And truly had he not improv'd the Uſe of theſe Tools, his Actions might have been ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before him, in order to his ſevere Puniſhment by a faithful Parliament. And, 2. he knew that ſome warm Men (as he called them) had an itching to have him by the Collar, and only forbore him becauſe of your Brother's Reſpect and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him: Theſe Reaſons were ſufficient for him to keep up the Power of thoſe Lords; for the Parliament was ſo kind, that when there was a vacancy in the Committee of the Articles, he had the nominating of one to ſucceed. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, contrary to the Cuſtom of the Parliament there, he cauſed all ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as were not named Lords of the Articles, to be excluded the Meetings of the Lords of the Articles, which you know was to no other End, than that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being leſs prepared, might the more implicitly go along with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Thus you may ſee what a Grievance theſe Lords of the Articles were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> by this time you cannot but ſee what havock you made of the Laws and Liberties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by thoſe two great Villains <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale.</hi> I might have enlarged upon this Subject, but 'twould fill a Volume to give account of every little Paſſage of yours there in order to enſlave that People, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Popery in that Kingdom.</p>

Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> tells you that your Father call'd that Parliament in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. 1640. <hi>Not more by the Advice of others, or by the Neceſſity of his own Affairs, than by his own Choice and Inclination.</hi> I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better from a <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſt than to begin with a Lie: For what Man that lived in that Time knew not how the Caſe ſtood with <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt? And beſides, if I had not Acceſs to a King, yet I could diſcover his Inclinations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thoſe that were about him, and in favour with him, or by the Currant of his Actions; all which, I ſay, teſtified to the World your Father's ſtrange averſneſs to a Parliament. Thoſe that were near him, and moſt in favour with him, were Courtiers and Raſcally Prelats, Vermin whoſe chief ſtudy was to find out how he ſtood inclined, and to imitate him exactly; and that which was his Will, was their Doctrine concerning Parliaments: and ſo it was with you. But that I may proceed in ſome Method, I ſhall ſhew, 1. That Parliaments are the Right of the People. 2. That they are an eſſential Part of the Government. 3. That you hated them, tho ſuch, and by conſequence was an Enemy to the Government of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That Parliaments are the Right of the People of <hi>England,</hi> which they may claim in order to have their Grievances redreſſed, the common Safety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for, and their Religion, Laws and Liberties ſecured: For call to mind, with delight if you can, the wonderful Diſcovery, and undeniable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Popiſh Plot, which deſigned ſo much Ruin and Miſchief to theſe Nations, in all things both Civil and Sacred, and the unanimous Senſe and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſo many Parliaments upon it, together with ſome Acts of Publick Juſtice upon many of the Traitors. The Nation was not without hopes, that ſince that curſed Deſign of introducing Popery and Slavery, and the Murder of your Brother, was diſcovered for the ſpace of 30 Months at leaſt, ſome effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſhould have been applied to prevent the Attempts of your Cut-throat Party upon us, the better to ſecure the Religion and Government of the Nation, and the Perſon of the King: But by ſad Experience we found, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigorous endeavours of three Parliaments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o provide proper and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws to anſwer both Ends, by your influencing a pack of Villains, you and your Party were ſo prevalent as to ſtifle in the Birth thoſe Righteous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of our Parliaments, by many ſurprizing Prorogations and Diſſolutions; whereby the Fears and Dangers of the People daily encreaſed, and the Spirits of you and your Party heightned to renew and multiply freſh Plots againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws and Liberties of the Realm. I will lay down ſome known Maxims that relate to a King and Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> 1. You know the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can do nothing as Kings, but what of Right they ought to do. 2. The King can neither do wrong, nor die. 3. The King's Prerogative and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Liberty are determined by Law. 4. The King has no Power but what the Law gives him; and is called King from ruling well, <hi>Rex à benè Regendo,</hi> viz. according to Law, and is only a King whilſt he rules well, but a Tyrant when he oppreſſes. 5. That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> never appear more in their Glory, and Majeſtick Sovereignty, than in Parliaments. 6. That the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100711:19"/>
of the Crown can do no wrong, nor can it be a Warrant for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> having laid down ſome Truths relating to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> give me leave to lay before you ſome that relate to the Parliament. 1. Then I ſay, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> conſtitutes and gives a Being to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England.</hi> 2. A Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is to the Government what the Soul is to the Body, which is only able to apprehend and underſtand the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of all Diſeaſes threatning the Body Politick. 3. A Parliament is the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of our Liberty, the Boundary which keeps the People of <hi>England</hi> from the Inundation of Tyrannical Power and Government. 4. Parliaments do make new, and abrogate old Laws, reform Grievances, ſettle the Succeſſion, grant Subſidies, and in a word may be called the Great Phyſician of the Kingdom. From all which it appears, if Parliaments are neceſſary in our Conſtitution, that they muſt have their Times of Seſſion and Continuation, to provide Laws eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially needful for the being and well-being of the People, and for redreſſing all Publick Grievances ariſing, either for want of Laws, or of undue execution of thoſe in being, or otherwiſe: And ſutable hereunto are thoſe Proviſions made by the Wiſdom of our Forefathers, as recorded by them both in the Common and Statute Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sir,</hi> you was an excellent Man at the Common Law, and ſo were your Gang at <hi>St. Germains;</hi> and tho they have little occaſion for it there, yet I may refreſh their Memories; for having had ſo much leaſure to ſtudy the Excellency of the French Religion and Government, our Common Law may be forgotten by them: Nay, Rhyming <hi>Jack Carryl</hi> himſelf, ſince the loſs of his Eſtate, may have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to forget the Law, ſince he will not have ſo much occaſion for it as he might have had, if he had choſen <hi>Suſſex</hi> inſtead of <hi>St. Germains,</hi> and ſo may be at a loſs to inform you. I therefore give you a touch or ſo, not that I pretend to cure the King's Evil of the Common Law what it ſaith concerning Parliaments. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> remember what old <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith, (one of your Grand-father's Judges, who was a famous Lawyer, and perſecuted by him for you know what, but never had the Courage to run away) he tells us in one of his Law Books, (which your old Friend <hi>Jenner</hi> ſwears he never underſtood) That <hi>the Common Law is founded in the immutable Law and Light of Nature, agreeable to the Law of God, requiring Order, Government, Subjection and Protection; containing certain antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages warranted by the Holy Scriptures; and becauſe given to all, is therefore called Common. Sir,</hi> if you will ſend for your old Drudg <hi>Frank Withens,</hi> I dare aver he cannot give you a better for his Life. But you will ſay, What is this to Parliaments? Well, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſince this may paſs the Underſtanding of your Diſpenſing Rogues, I will tell you what he ſaith in his <hi>9th</hi> Book in the Preface, they are his own Words in the Book called <hi>the Mirror of Juſtice,</hi> in which appears the whole Frame of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Common Laws of this Realm from the Time of K. <hi>Arthur, An.</hi> 516, till near the Conqueſt; which treats alſo of the Officers, as well as the Diverſity and Diſtinction of the Courts of Juſtice, (which are <hi>Officina Legis)</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the High Court of Parliament, ſo called from <hi>Parlerlament,</hi> ſpeaking judicially his Mind: And amongſt others, he gives us the following Law of K. <hi>Alfred,</hi> who reigned in 880, and ordained for a Uſage perpetual, <hi>That twice a Year, or oftner if need be, in time of Peace, they ſhall aſſemble themſelves at</hi> London
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100711:19"/>
                  <hi>to treat in Parliament of the Government of the People of God; how they ſhould keep themſelves from Offences, ſhould live in quiet, and ſhould receive Right by certain Laws and holy Judgments. And thus</hi> (ſaith this Great <hi>Coke) you have the Law of K.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, <hi>as well concerning the holding this Court of Parliament here every Year at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> London, <hi>as to manifeſt the threefold End of this Great and Honourable Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That Men might be kept from offending, that is, that Offences might be prevented, both by good and provident Laws, and by the due Execution of them. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> here is Grief in one Hand, and Sorrow in the other; for your Brother and you, you hated the one, and deſpiſed the other. Provident Laws you hated, as much as you did an honeſt Woman; and the other you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed as much as you did an honeſt Man: And you were never more at eaſe, than when thrô the want of a good Law, or ſo, you and your Party were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emboldned, but enabled to do Miſchief.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That all Men might live ſafely and quiet. This is another End of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Old <hi>Wright,</hi> your <hi>quondam Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>That the Man that reſigned himſelf up to the Will of his Prince, was always ſafe and quiet.</hi> But yet that Loggerhead of a Judg, with Old <hi>Hodg</hi> and all his Inferior Crew, could never find one ſuch Saying in the Reports or Inſtitutes of Judg <hi>Coke;</hi> for the Saying was ſo ſilly, that a Man muſt have judged it to have been his own, unleſs he had humbly borrowed that wiſe Saying from <hi>(Sir)</hi> your ſweet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Self; for he underſtood as little of the Deſign and End of a Parliament as your ſelf: The Wretch is gone to his Place, but as for Law and Parliaments, no Man (no not <hi>Jenner</hi> himſelf) underſtood leſs than his Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That all Men might receive Juſtice by certain Laws and Holy Judgments, not by Proclamations, or French Edicts, as you and your Brother did deſign, but by certain Laws, to the end Juſtice might be the better adminiſtred, that Queſtions and Defects in Laws might be by the High Court of Parliament explained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to certainty. Your Brother and you, if you had underſtood this, would not have ſent for a ſet of Rogues clothed in Purple to have gained their Opinion about ſuſpending the Penal Laws againſt a parcel of Papiſts and Popiſh Prieſts; no, you would have applied your ſelves to Parliament to have explained the difficult and dark Parts of the Laws in force againſt thoſe Men; but you loved Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and dark Judges, and therefore what you did was dark; for <hi>(Sir)</hi> your Brother and you little thought and believed that the High Court of Parliament was the Supream Court of the Realm, and that it was a part of the Frame of the Common Laws, and that in ſome Caſes Parliaments do proceed legally according to the Courſe of the Common Laws. Had your Brother or you underſtood or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Antiquity of Parliaments, you would not have preferred a Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil before them; nor if you had valued the Dignity of Parliaments, would you have preferred the Opinion of a parcel of Lambskin Rogues before a plain and poſitive Law; nor if you had learned the Sovereign Juriſdiction of Parliaments, would you have followed the Advice and Direction of your villanous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, tho againſt the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Government. I wonder you did not take the Villains along with you to <hi>St. Germains,</hi> your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Judges, and your Counſellors, Learned in the Law, your <hi>Wrights, Jenners, Miltons, Withers, Sawyers,</hi> and the reſt of the Helliſh Crew: I do not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100711:20"/>
name them all, but you might have had the Honeſty not to have left them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace their Profeſſion, which is well improved ſince I ſaw you laſt, and to have procured an Apartment for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that your Miniſters might have thought upon ſome better Politicks, and your Roguy Judges and Lawyers might have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Law a little better than <hi>ſcribere eſt agere:</hi> If that Bird had been but hang'd up in a Cage in your Preſence-Chamber, he would have ſung another Tune: For all his Brave-alls, he and the reſt of his Crew might have found ſome Expedient or another to have helped you to ſome other Kingdom, ſince by the Law of ſome of them, and the Politicks of others, they fairly walked you out of three Kingdoms at once. I do not ſee any great Reformation of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or any great Improvement they have made of their Law ſince you was graciouſly pleaſed to take up your Reſidence at <hi>St. Germains;</hi> and if you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Vermin along with you, there might have been a parcel of Dragoons that might have drub'd them to their Books; ſo that by their <hi>Scribere's</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere's</hi> they might have found ſome convenient Government for you, which they might have kept you in to better purpoſe, than did by their Law and Counſel keep you here: Nay, if you had advanced them a little above their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they might have ſeen the difference between a Declaration of Indulgence, and a Statute-Law for Liberty of Conſcience, and between an Act of Parliament and a Proclamation. A good Whip (dear <hi>Sir)</hi> would have been of admirable Uſe and Inſtruction; for it would have made them to underſtand, and they would have told you, tho ſomewhat too late; 1. That Parliaments are part of the Frame of the Common Law, which is founded on the Law and Light of Nature, right Reaſon and Scripture. 2. That according to this Law of Equity and Righteouſneſs, Parliaments ought freely to meet, for the Common Peace, Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Benefit of the People, and Support of the Government. 3. That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have been all along eſteemed the Eſſential Part of the Government, as being the moſt Antient, Honourable and Sovereign Court in the Nation, which ought frequently to meet and ſit for the making and aboliſhing of Laws, redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Grievances, and to ſee to the due Adminiſtration of Juſtice. 4. That as to the Place of the meeting, it ought to be at <hi>London,</hi> not at <hi>New-Market;</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> not at <hi>Windſor;</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> not at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> becauſe <hi>London</hi> is the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City, the Eye and Heart of the Nation, as being not only the Royal Seat, but the principal Place of Judicature, and Reſidence of the chief Officers and Courts of Juſtice; where alſo the Records are kept, as well as the principal Place of Commerce and Concourſe in the Nation; and to which the People may have the beſt Recourſe, and where they may find the beſt Accommodation. 5. They would have inſtructed you in the Antiquity of Parliaments, which have been ſo Antient that no Record can give an Account of their beginning. Upon my word I will tell you, that a little Chaſtiſement upon theſe Villains, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of your Dragoons, would have wrought a mighty Change upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(Sir)</hi> ſince you have nothing elſe to do, ſend for them; you ſhall have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them that are above Ground; and if they do not anſwer Expectation, then hang 'em all, and I do think they ſhould be content: For <hi>Paſſive-Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-reſistance,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Right of Ignorance,</hi> are ſo fixt in their Bones, that nothing but a good dragooning Flux will fetch them out.</p>

In a word, <hi>Sir,</hi> now it is eaſily known why your Brother in his Reign did not ſuffer Parliaments to meet and ſit, for thoſe Ends for which a Parliament was at firſt conſtituted; for ſuch Rogues as I have mentioned, uſed to teach him the ſame Doctrine that they taught you, only with theſe different Effects, which wrought more upon you than it did upon him: For all the brave Notions they gave him of Prerogative and Abſolute Power, and the Excellency of the Romiſh Religion above all other Religions, could neither give him Strength enough to get Old <hi>Catherine</hi> with Child, nor Courage enough to run away. Now the ſame Doctrine that your Lawyers, Judges, and Miniſters of State taught you, had theſe wonderful Influences upon you of getting a Child for us, or ſhamming one upon us, and running from us without the Aid and Aſſiſtance of an old Engliſh Parliament. The Rogues were running after you; it had been no great matter if he, ſhe, or they had been hang'd that ſtopt them. But the Vermin by this time are come to themſelves, and can tell you for a need, that not to ſuffer Parliaments to ſit to anſwer the great Ends for which they were inſtituted, was and ſtill is expreſly contrary to the Common Law, and ſo conſequently of the Law of God as well as the Law of Nature; and thereby Violence hath been by your Brother and you offered to the Government it ſelf, and an Infringement of the Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. We have laid before you what the Common Law ſaith concerning Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore it will (in the ſecond place) be convenient to obſerve what our Statute Law acquaints us withal concerning Parliaments. I know you had a great Love to our Laws; and therefore I ſuppoſe you have read them, that when you come again you may make better uſe of them than you did before, and not have the Courage to diſpenſe with them as you did before. Old <hi>Jenner</hi> thought a Wife and nine Children was an admirable Argument for the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, and ſwears when you come again, he will never ſet up for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of the Law any more; he will rather turn Prieſt, to put you into the way of gaining the Kingdom of Heaven, ſince he expounded the Law in ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a manner as to make you loſe the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> But to the Point:</p>
               <p>The Statute Laws (the Learned ſay) are Acts of Parliament, which are or ought to be only declaratory of the Common Law; which, as you have it told you, is founded upon right Reaſon and Scripture; and I think our Learned in the Law have told us, That if any thing be enacted contrary thereunto, it is null and void, and of no Effect. Certainly <hi>Jenner</hi> and the reſt of the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Crew were bewitch'd, in not telling you that any Diſpenſation againſt Law was in it ſelf null and void: But there was a Wife and nine Children in the Caſe, and Law was not his Buſineſs. Truly for all his huſſing Speech to the Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he knew as little Law as your ſelf that ſent him down: But ſince ſome of the Villains were ignorant of the Law, and the reſt of them that had ſome Law and no Honeſty, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, I pray let me intreat your Patience, and obſerve what I ſay to you. There are ſeveral Statutes that require frequent meetings of Parliament agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Common Law.</p>

The firſt of which is 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. in theſe words; <hi>Item, it is accorded that a Parliament ſhall be holden every Year once, or more often if need be.</hi> Alas, that good King never ſent to the French King for leave to call a Parliament, nor did he ſell him a Seſſion of Parliament for a ſmall Spell of 300000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into the old Judges Noddles in his Reign, that Parliaments were to be held ſooner or later, oftner or ſeldomer, as the King pleaſed; no, it was your Lambskin Crew you ſet up in <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>'s Time that taught that Doctrine: Nay, there were a Set of Rogues in your Father's Time who favoured that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy in the Government, that the meeting and ſitting of Parliaments was at the Will and Pleaſure of the King; but your Rogues went a Note above <hi>Ela,</hi> for they would have the Laws to be diſpenſed with, or ſuſpended, when the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pleaſure of the King was ſuch.</p>

               <p>Well, <hi>Sir,</hi> what's the Engliſh of all this? Your Judges have told you what the French of it is already to your Coſt: Now it ſhall coſt you nothing if we tell you the Engliſh of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Parliament ought Annually to meet to ſupport the Government, and to redreſs Grievances happening in the interval of Parliaments, that being the great End propoſed in their ſaid meeting. Now for Parliaments to meet Annually, and not be ſuffered to ſit to anſwer the Ends, but to be prorogued or diſſolved, (as Gammer <hi>Carwell</hi> or <hi>Nell Waal</hi> ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect) before they had finiſhed their Work, was and would be nothing but an eluding the Law, and ſtriking at the Foundation of the Government, and rendring Parliaments altogether uſeleſs. You know there is no great difference between having no Meat at all, and having it in abundance without being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to eat; ſo I think it is to no purpoſe to have frequent Parliaments, and they not ſuffered to ſit and do the Buſineſs of the Nation, for which they were ſent by the People, as well as called by the King. You had got ſuch a Trick in your Brother's Time to put off Parliaments, that I doubt if we ſhould try you once more, and take in thoſe <hi>durante bene placito</hi> Rogues, you would never leave it off: Firſt you got one Seſſion put off, and a truly loyal Band of Penſioners diſſolved; then three Parliaments diſſolved one upon the neck of another, as you and <hi>Nell Waal</hi> pleaſed. Now our Forefathers, and our Antient Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to prevent Arbitrary Power, and ſuch intolerable Miſchiefs as theſe, did heartily agree to have a Proclamation made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> before the End of every Seſſion, not to diſſolve the Parliament to get a Sum of French Money, but to tell the People that all who had any Matter to preſent to the Parliament, ſhould bring it before ſuch a Day, for otherwiſe the Parliament ſhould determine. This was done in the Reigns of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. So that you may ſee, and ſo might

that Villain <hi>Jefferies,</hi> that the People were not to be eluded or diſappointed by ſurpriſing Prorogations and Diſſolutions, to fruſtrate the great Ends of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuppoſe all your Brother's Crew of Judges and Miniſters of State, nay I would allow him half a dozen Prieſts, and Dr. <hi>Finch</hi> the Warden of <hi>All-Souls</hi> into the Bargain, who is an excellent Preacher and Pimp to the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Arbitrary Power; nay I will allow you to have the French Parliament held at <hi>New-Market</hi> in 1677; and ſuppoſe they ſhould have roared with open Mouth, and ſaid there was no Record, nor Statute upon Record extant concerning the ſitting of Parliaments to redreſs Grievances: What then? And ſuppoſe <hi>Finch</hi> the laſt <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> had told ſuch a Story as this in his loggerheaded Sermon, where he applauded the eminent ſhining Vertues of <hi>Charles</hi> II, above thoſe of his Royal Father and yours, his Chaſtity, Integrity, Peaceableneſs, and the like; and provided all he had ſaid were true, that <hi>Charles</hi> was a Man of thoſe Vertues, and that there were neither Common nor Statute Laws extant for the ſitting of Parliaments; yet by Warden <hi>Finch</hi>'s leave it is more certain that Parliaments are to ſit and redreſs Grievances by the Fundamental Laws of the Government, than that his Father preſented the Grand Seignior with a Pendulum Clock ſo ſmall, that the Grand Seignior hung it at his Ear, as the Ladies here uſed to hang their Pendants at theirs.</p>
               <p>It may be, <hi>Sir,</hi> you will ask what Reaſon I could have to believe the ſitting of Parliaments for redreſs of Grievances was our Right by the Fundamental Law of <hi>England?</hi> I tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> why, becauſe the Government muſt be lame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and a Prince and his villanous Miniſters might have done what they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Wills might have been their Laws. Your Brother and you bid fair for ſuch a Government, had your Friend <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Advice been taken, and had K. <hi>Charles</hi> ſigned his Declaration for diſſolving the Parliament. <hi>Coleman</hi> had not <hi>Jenner</hi>'s Courage of running away, and ſo the Declaration was not ſigned, but to your great Comfort he was graciouſly left to dance a <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> Gambrel at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for his great pains in the mighty Work your Brother, your Self, and he had upon your Hands. Therefore, my good Friend, it was provided for in the very Eſſence and Conſtitution of the Government it ſelf; this we may (if <hi>Frank Withens</hi> and the reſt of your Crew will give leave) call Common Law, tho <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> once was pleaſed to call it a <hi>Common Where:</hi> This (notwithſtanding the filthy Expreſſion of that impudent Villain, that had neither Law, Manners, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, but the Impudence of ten carted Whores) is of as much Value (if not more) as any Statute, and of which all our good Acts of Parliament, and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta</hi> it ſelf, are but declaratory: So that tho your Brother, or any King elſe, had been intruſted with the formal Part of ſummoning and pronouncing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Parliaments, which is done by Writ; yet the Laws that oblige the King as well as the People, have determined when and how it is to be done. This is enough to ſhew you, that your Brother as King ſhared in the Sovereignty that was in the Parliament, and that it was cut out to him by Law, and not left at his Diſpoſal: I muſt therefore tell you that <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> and the reſt of the Bloodhounds, and murdering Diſpenſing Judges, were much out in point of Law, when they told your Brother; that Parliaments, both as to Calling and Diſſolving, were at his Will and Pleaſure.</p>

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100711:22"/>
3. There is another Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. that was Law in your Brother's Reign, which the Judges, if they had been acquainted with the Law, who truly (except a few that had but little Honeſty, and were generally Strangers to the Law) muſt have told him and you too, did oblige him and you to ſuffer the Meeting and Sitting of Parliaments: Therefore I make uſe of that Statute to prove that the Meeting and Sitting of Parliaments is the Fundamental Right and Privilege of the People of <hi>England.</hi> This Statute, <hi>Sir,</hi> was called the <hi>Statute of Proviſors,</hi> and was made to prevent and cut off the Incroachments of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Uſurpations in diſpoſing of Benefices had occaſioned intolerable Grievances: In the Preamble of which Statute it is expreſſed as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon the Commons have prayed our ſaid Sovereign Lord the King, That ſince the Right of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Law of the Realm is ſuch, that upon the Miſchiefs and Damage which happen to this Realm, he ought, and is bounden of the Accord of his ſaid People in his Parliament, thereof to make Remedy and Law in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the Miſchiefs and Damage which thereof cometh, that it may pleaſe him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to provide Remedy. Our Sovereign Lord the King, ſeeing the Miſchiefs and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage before-named, and having regard to the ſaid Statute made in the Time of his ſaid Grandfather, and to the Cauſes contained in the ſame; which Statute holdeth always its Force, and was never defeated or annulled in any Point, and by ſo much is bound by his Oath to do the ſame, to be kept as the Law of this Realm, tho that by ſufferance and negligence it hath ſince been attempted to the contrary; and alſo having regard to the grievous Complaints made to him by his People in divers Parliaments holden hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, willing to ordain Remedy for the great Damages and Miſchiefs which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and daily do happen by the ſaid Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the Aſſent of the Great Men and Commonalty of his ſaid Realm, hath ordained and eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> what ſay you to all this? Where is your <hi>Holloway,</hi> your <hi>Withens,</hi> and your <hi>Walcots?</hi> And where is <hi>Tom Jenner,</hi> with his Sorrow in one Hand and his Grief in the other, an ignorant Raſcal like the reſt of his Brethren? Where is your <hi>Herbert,</hi> your <hi>Heath,</hi> and your <hi>Milton?</hi> Some of them are gone to their Places, but they lived long enough to enſlave the People; and thoſe that yet live, owe a Debt for their Rogueries, the Gallows groans for their perverting of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgment. Where are your murdering Judges of the Weſt? Some of them yet live: They might (without the Conſent of a pair of Spectacles) have ſeen, and might without fear have told you, they could not chuſe but ſee what was contained in this Preamble now recited. Were the Rogues ignorant? Then why did not your <hi>Pemberton,</hi> your <hi>Scroggs,</hi> your <hi>Levins,</hi> your <hi>Charlton,</hi> and the reſt of that Crew, inſtruct your Brother and you what was contained and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in this Preamble? But alas, they did not; they were able enough, but they had raſcally <hi>durante bene placito</hi> Commiſſions, that indiſpoſed them to be plain and honeſt in that Affair; they were more afraid of loſing their Places, than of being damn'd for not doing their Duties: But ſince they had not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Honeſty and Conſcience of upright Judges, give me leave to be plain with you. Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The intolerable Grievance and Burden occaſioned by the illegal Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which Yoke you and your Villains endeavour'd to reduce and ſubjugate theſe Kingdoms. You fired our City, and murdered our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100711:22"/>
Friends; you promoted Men of Villanous Principles, and worſe Morals, to the Judgment-Seat, and made them Vaſſals to your Will and Pleaſure; who, if they complied not, were reproachfully diſmiſſed their Imployments, and ruined if poſſible: Nay, if any of them attempted but to proſecute Popery; alas, they were not for your Turn, for your Deſign was by them to revive that intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grievance, by incouraging the illegal Incroachments of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Obſerve the many Complaints the People had made, who in thoſe dark Times under Popery groan'd under ſuch Burdens: What Burdens, I pray you, under the Incroachments of the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> Why truly in diſpoſing of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Ay, it is a good Obſervation, for the Pope would preſent none but ſuch as ſhould advance his uſurped Power and Intereſt; and if the People were ſo bold as to complain of theſe things, were they not a parcel of Rebels and Traitors for their pains? No, they complain'd without being called or treated as ſuch. What Remedy had they? A Parliament. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> had not we as much need of an Act of Proviſors againſt you? for in your Brother's Time, how many of your Rogues were preſented to the beſt Livings in the Realm at your Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how many Villains were made Biſhops by the Whores <hi>Cleveland</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and the Pimps and Bawds at Court? Did not we ſtand in need of Statutes of Proviſors? Name me one Man of theſe that were not to advance the Power and Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and to wink at the Progreſs and Growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Had we not reaſon to complain? Yes: To whom? to the King? No, he was engaged for Popery and the French Intereſt, and Arbitrary Power, as well as your ſelf: His Metropolitan Whores were Papiſts to pleaſe him, or he one to pleaſe them: Therefore to what purpoſe was it? We had none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to but a Parliament; and how you uſed them, we have not forgot; and how our Application to them was not only uſeleſs, but dangerous, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. In a word, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Condition of the Complainants in the Time of <hi>Edw.</hi> III, tho they lived in the dark Times of Popery, were in a far better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than we were in your Brother's Reign; for notwithſtanding the Religion of <hi>Edw.</hi> III, his Intereſt was his Peoples, and therefore held frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to whom they might complain, and from whom they might find Redreſs, without being judged Traitors and Rebels to the Government.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Obſerve the Endeavours uſed in vain by former Parliaments to redreſs the ſame, and to bring their Laws in being to have their Force and Effect. You know that when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were wicked, then to gain the Point, they uſed to fly to <hi>Rome</hi> for Countenance, and advance that uſurped Power to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the People. So it was with your Brother and you, when you had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in hand to enſlave the Nation; then you ſet up the Power and Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and none were to be preferred in our good Church but Villains, that were caſe-hardned enough to join with your Brother and you in raviſhing the Peoples Rights and Franchiſes. Had we good Laws in being againſt Popery? They were ſuſpended. Had we any good Laws againſt the growing Greatneſs of <hi>France?</hi> Yes, we got one poor Act of Parliament againſt <hi>France,</hi> and that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded. Nay, now I think on't, we got an Act to enter into an actual War againſt <hi>France,</hi> with which your Party did impudently beg Money from <hi>France.</hi> We got
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100711:23"/>
a poor ſorry Act for the Liberty of the Subject, called the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act; this was by you and your Villains evaded; ſo that we were under a neceſſity of Complaining. Thoſe in the Time of <hi>Edw.</hi> III, had redreſs; we had none, till we drove you and the French Intereſt and Popery out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Obſerve the Acknowledgment of the King and Parliament, that the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to this Duty was upon the King, who you know is entruſted by the Law to preſerve the Peace and Liberties of the Realm, and to rectify all Miſcarriages in the Government: Which is apparent, 1. From the Right of the Crown, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging him to paſs good Laws. 2. There were good Laws committed to his Truſt in full Force, which he was to execute. 3. There is the King's Oath to paſs new Laws for the Peoples Safeguard which they ſhould tender to him, as well as to execute old Laws already made. 4. From the Senſe of the People expreſt in their Complaints. And, 5. From the Miſchief and Damage that would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe enſue; and therefore it is ſaid, that by the Deſire and Accord of his People he paſt this famous Law, the Preamble of which I have recited to you in part.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is another Statute worthy of your Conſideration, and pretty much to the ſame purpoſe; you will find it in the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 28. <hi>Alſo the Commons of</hi> England <hi>in Parliament deſire, that foraſmuch as Petitions and Bills pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Parliament by divers of the Commons, could not heretofore have their reſpective Anſwers; that therefore both their Petitions and Bills in this preſent Parliament, as alſo all others which ſhall be preſented in any future Parliament, may have a Good and Gracious Anſwer, and Remedy ordained thereupon, before the departing of every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and to this purpoſe a due Statute be enſealed (or enacted) at this preſent Parliament, to be and remain in Force for all Times to come.</hi> To which the King replied thus, <hi>The King is pleaſed that all ſuch Petitions delivered in Parliament of Things or Matters which cannot otherwiſe be determined, a good and reaſonable Anſwer ſhall be made and given before the departure of the Parliament.</hi> This King, you know, left not a very good Name behind, being drawn away from loving his People, juſt as you and your Brother were by a ſet of wicked Rogues; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had raviſhed this Prince, and weaned him from his Peoples Love, he made this excellent Law: in which, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may obſerve, 1. A Complaint of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Remiſneſs; their Bills afore-time have not been paſſed, and their Grievances unredreſſed, by unſeaſonably diſſolving of Parliaments before their Laws could paſs. 2. That a Law might paſs in that very Parliament to rectify that Abuſe for the future. And, 3. that it ſhould not paſs for a Temporary Law, but to laſt for ever, being of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity, that before Parliaments be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Bills of Common Right might paſs: to which the then King <hi>Richard</hi> did freely agree.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I have another Proof, which is from that great Oracle of the Law the Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Inſtitut.</hi> 4. B. <hi>p.</hi> 11. aſſerting, That <hi>Petitions may be truly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, tho very many have been anſwered by the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament before the end of the Parliament.</hi> This that Great Lawyer delivers not as his own ſingle Opinion, but tells us that what he laid down in this Particular, appeared in an Antient Treatiſe <hi>de modo tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> in theſe words faithfully tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>The Parliament ought not to be ended while any Petition dependeth undiſcuſſed, or</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100711:23"/>
                  <hi>at leaſt to which a determinate Anſwer is not made.</hi> And again, <hi>That one Principle of calling Parliaments is for the redreſſing Grievances that daily happen.</hi> Further yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the departing of Parliaments; <hi>It ought to be in ſuch a manner</hi> (ſaith <hi>Modus Tenendi) demanded, yea and publickly proclaimed in the Parliament, and within the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Parliament, whether there be any that hath delivered a Petition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath not received anſwer thereto: If there be none ſuch, it is to be ſuppoſed that every one is ſatisfied, or elſe anſwered unto at the leaſt, ſo far forth as by the Law he may be.</hi> This Cuſtom was obſerved in after Ages, as you heard before. Once more, and I have done: Obſerve what this Great Judg ſaith concerning the Authority and Antiquity of this Antient Treatiſe called <hi>Modus tenendi Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> which we often make uſe of in our Inſtitutes: Certain it is, this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> was rehearſed and declared before <hi>William</hi> I. called the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and by him approved for <hi>England;</hi> upon which, according to the <hi>Modus,</hi> he held a Parliament for <hi>England,</hi> as appears 21 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Fo.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Sir,</hi> how do you by this time, and how doth my old Miſtreſs and the little Welch Gentleman? Are you not ſatisfied of the Neceſſity of the Meeting and Sitting of Parliaments? I pray call <hi>Tom Jenner,</hi> and <hi>Frank Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> thoſe two Raſcals, and all the Crew of Villains that miſled your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and you, or were miſled by you; for they were willing Vermin, I confeſs, to do what they were bid, upon pain and peril of loſing their Places: And leſt theſe Scoundrels ſhould be too ignorant, let us call in Old <hi>Pemberton</hi> that did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Jobs of Journey-work for your Brother and you; he impudently tried <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> tho he was impeached in Parliament, which <hi>Scroggs</hi> would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake; and he tried the Great and never-to-be forgotten Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and how he carried himſelf, let the World judg: I am ſure my Ld <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But I have heard <hi>Pemberton</hi> talk as like a Villain as any of the reſt, which was not becauſe of his Ignorance. I ſay, let us ſummon them all that remain in the Land of the Living, for the Devil hath not fetch'd them all yet; and tho they are not prating upon the Bench, yet the Rogues are getting a Penny at the Bar: Theſe Vermin I dare ſay with a little drubbing will aver, that it is moſt certain theſe wholſome Laws are not only in full Agreement with the Common Law, and declarative thereof, but fully agree with the Oath and Office of our Kings, who have that great Truſt by the Law lodged with them for the Good and Benefit, and not Hurt and Miſchief of the People. But if theſe Dunghil Raſcals ſhould be fullen, becauſe not imployed once more to oppreſs and murder the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Form and Colour of Law, and refuſe to ſatisfy you, I will with that little Law I have, propoſe theſe three things upon the whole of what has been ſaid upon this fifth Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Theſe Laws are very ſutable to the Office and Duty of a King, and the End for which he was inſtituted by God himſelf, who commands him to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgment to all, eſpecially the Oppreſſed, but not deny them any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for their Relief, Protection or Welfare. It had not been below you to have obey'd the Laws as a Subject, nor your Brother to have kept them as a King; and had he relied more upon his Parliament than he did upon your Counſel, and that of his wicked Miniſtry, he might have liv'd to this Day: But you and your Crew perſwaded him he was above Laws, and that the Statutes of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100711:24"/>
the Realm ſignified nothing no longer than they would ſerve his Turn; who therefore made no Conſcience of the Sitting of Parliaments for redreſs of Grievances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Theſe Laws relating to Parliaments do alſo fully agree with the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oath your Brother took, and ſolemnly made to his People, <hi>viz. To grant, fulfil and defend all rightful Laws which the Commons of the Realm ſhall chuſe, and to ſtrengthen and maintain them to the utmoſt of his Power.</hi> But, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuppoſe any of the Learned in the Laws of the Realm ſhould ſtand at your Elbow, as <hi>Tom Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or Old <hi>Holloway,</hi> or any of that Crew, and tell you that your Brother did not take any ſuch Oath: To this I may ſay, that if he did not, the Nation had the more wrong; but I never heard yet that any had the Impudence to deny it. I confeſs when you ſhuffled on the Crown, it was ſaid ſome things were abated, for which thoſe concerned in that Ceremony ought to have been hanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Thoſe Laws do alſo fully agree with <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, which hath been confirmed to us by 40 Parliaments at leaſt, which ſaith, <hi>We ſhall deny nor defer to no Man Juſtice and Right,</hi> much leſs to the whole Parliament and Kingdom, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and deferring to paſs ſuch neceſſary Bills the Neceſſities of the People call for. Had Old <hi>Brown</hi> had but half the Honeſty of an Iriſh Rapparee, he would not have conſented to your Brother's dropping of a Bill in the Year 1680, it was intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An Act for repealing an Act of the 35th of Q.</hi> Elizabeth; a good Bill to have preſerved the Proteſtant Diſſenters: But your Party had ſome barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Outrages to commit, and could not well go on with their Show unleſs ſuch a Bill as that of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in Force; ſo that it might now and then aid and aſſiſt your everlaſting Holy Cut-throats in their bloody Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you may ſay, <hi>That your Brother and Father, and ſeveral other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have otherwiſe practiſed, by diſſolving or proroguing Parliaments at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, before Grievances were redreſſed, and publick Bills of Common-Safety paſſed, becauſe to diſſolve and prorogue at Pleaſure, is a Privilege which belongs to the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This word <hi>Prorogue</hi> is but a new-fangled Buſineſs, a thing brought up in latter Days; but as for diſſolving Parliaments at Pleaſure, that has been the Practice of our former wicked Kings, by the Advice of their Roguiſh Miniſters and Judges, who laid aſide all Law, Honour, Honeſty and Conſcience, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute themſelves to the abominable Luſt of a filthy Prince, who deſigned nothing leſs than the Ruin of the Kingdom. What your Father did I will not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf; but what your Brother did by your Procurement, is my Province at this Time.</p>
               <p>Your Brother when he held his French Parliament at <hi>New-Market</hi> in 1677, where moſt of the Rogues and Whores of the Court were preſent, and your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Self waiting on him, did much aggrandize himſelf by that Glorious Aſſembly. Upon <hi>April</hi> 16. the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was adjourned till <hi>May</hi> 21. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>There were, I ſuppoſe, ſeveral Private Bills in favour of the Pimps, Bawds, and Whores, that were not ſworn in Ordinary, but paſſed the Royal Aſſent, as I may ſuppoſe, becauſe at that time all things between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> moved with that punctual Regularity, that it was like the Harmony of the Spheres, ſo conſonant with themſelves, tho I could not hear the Muſick. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> let us know in your next Declaration what other Secret Bills were paſſed in that Auguſt Aſſembly, wherein the Affairs of Peace and War were tranſacted with the greateſt Confidence; and when, good Boys, they had done their Maſter's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with your Brother's Aid and Help, they were adjourned from <hi>New-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where they diſſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> theſe were Matters of that Import, that they required all imaginable Expedition and Secreſy; and it would have been the higheſt Preſumption for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100711:25"/>
poor Penſioners in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament to have intermedled with them. Alas, if they had been admitted to end the Work, it might have ended in their own Diſſolution, in order to a couragious running away.</p>
               <p>You ſay by way of Objection, Your Partiſans made that which your Brother and other Kings did by their Prerogative Royal, diſſolve Parliaments before Grievances were redreſſed and neceſſary Bills paſt, becauſe things did not move with that punctual Regularity between your Brother and them, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the French King. I pray what was the Reaſon? Had they not had Gratuities at the Charge of the Nation? Or, had the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> jilted them out of the French King's Bleſſing, which the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rheims</hi> brought them of 200000 <hi>Lewis d' Ores?</hi> Who can tell what to ſay to theſe things? It is no wonder then that Crew of Voters were grown reſty, and did not move regularly. Well, what then? the Parliament muſt not ſit till ſome State-Clockmaker had mended their Motions, and made them go true; the Houſe then had ſome good Bills, over which they roared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then were ſent Home by a blaſt of Prerogative-Breath.</p>
               <p>Had your Brother any other Prerogative but what the Law gave him, and what he was inveſted with at his Coronation? If he had, let us know it; but for once I will grant he prorogued and diſſolved Parliaments at his Pleaſure to ſerve you and your Cut-throat Crew: It doth not therefore follow that he had a Right ſo to do, according to a Maxim I learned almoſt 30 Years ſince, <hi>A facto ad jus non valet conſequentia,</hi> eſpecially when ſuch Prorogations and Diſſolutions are againſt ſo many expreſs and poſitive Laws, ſuch Principles of Common Right and Juſtice, and ſo many particular Ties and Obligations to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Your Brother might, by the Advice of wicked Stateſmen and villanous Judges, pretend to a Prerogative the Law had given him, of which nothing ever was known, unleſs revealed by ſome French Maxims learned abroad in his Travels: Yet ſuch a Prerogative could not juſtify ſuch Practices; for if he had been inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch Prerogatives by the Law, yet the Law could give none to deſtroy it ſelf, and thoſe it protects.</p>
               <p>But Old <hi>Hodg</hi> and his Inferior Clergy may interpoſe and ſay, Had not King <hi>Charles</hi> his Prerogative founded upon Law? Who queſtions, <hi>Sir,</hi> but the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had their Prerogatives? Yet obſerve what Old <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 487. That tho the Common Law allows many Prerogatives to the King, yet it allows none by which to hurt or prejudice any. Therefore with the Learned in the Law I will aſſert, That whatever Power or Prerogative your Brother had, ought to have been uſed according to the true Intent of the Government, that is, to preſerve the People and their Intereſt, and not to hinder a Parliament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Grievances, and providing for the future Execution of the Laws; and whenever he applied his Prerogative to fruſtrate theſe Ends, by the Advice of you or any wicked Perſon, it was a Violation of Right, and the Breach of his Coronation Oath, ſince he ſtood oblig'd to Paſs or Confirm thoſe Laws his People ſhould chuſe in the Time of his Reign.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Your Brother and you had little or no regard to the Laws: All the Cry of your Villains was <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and nothing was indured that was according to Law: Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> I will give you a Proof, by Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s leave, from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100711:25"/>
the Words of your own Father, who when in Priſon began to recollect himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f a little, and gave your Brother this Advice when he ſhould come to the Crown; <hi>That Prerogative is beſt ſhewed and exerciſed in remitting, rather than exacting the Rigour of the Laws, there being nothing worſe than Legal Tyranny; nor would he have him entertain any Averſion or Diſlike of Parliaments, which in their Right Conſtitution with Freedom and Honour, will never injure or diminiſh his Greatneſs, but will rather be as interchangings of Love, Loyalty, and Confidence between a Prince and his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> if the Reports and Opinions of the beſt Lawyers could not, yet the Counſel of his Father the King, or his Father in God, might have wrought upon him and you: But the Truth is, in the Time of <hi>Richard</hi> II, there were ſome Flaterers and Traitors that preſumed, in defiance of their Countries Rights, to aſſert ſuch a boundleſs Prerogative in the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſillian,</hi> and others, adviſing him that he might diſſolve Parliaments at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that no Member ſhould be called to Parliament, nor any Act paſt in either Houſe without his Approbation in the firſt place; and that whoever did adviſe otherwiſe were Traitors: But this Advice was no leſs fatal to himſelf, than pernicious to his Prince. To which let me add a Saying of your Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Speech to his Parliament in 1609, in which he gives them Aſſurance, <hi>That he never meant to govern by any other Law than the Law of the Land:</hi> And tho it be diſputed among them as if he intended to alter the Law, and govern by the abſolute Power of a King, yet to put them out of doubt, he tells them that all Kings, who are not Tyrants or Perjured, will bind themſelves within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their Laws; and they that perſwade the contrary, are Vipers, and Peſts both againſt them and the Commonwealth. Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have plainly proved, that Parliaments are the Right of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and that no King, without the Breach of his Coronation-Oath, can govern without them. I come now to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="2">II. That they are the Eſſential Part of the Government. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have had occaſion to prove that as a neceſſary Conſequence of the foreſaid Right: but ſomething may be offered to prove this Point, which will aggravate your Crime, and the Villany of your Party in attempting to render this Eſſential Part of the Government uſeleſs. Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> when you are at leiſure, conſider with your ſelf the Conſtitution of the Government, which your Brother did wound, and you attempted utterly to deſtroy, but therein loſt your ſelf and this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which would have been worth your keeping. Take a View therefore of the Conſtitution of the Engliſh Government, where the King is the Head, from whom the Government it ſelf receiveth its Life, as he from the Law receiveth his Power: He has the Care of the whole, and it is his Intereſt to ſeek its Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: The Strength of the Nation is his Strength, and the Riches of the Nation his Riches: The Glory and Honour of the Nation is his Glory and Honour. So on the contrary, when the Nation is weak, he is weak; if it be impoveriſhed, he is impoveriſhed; if it loſe itss Honour and Glory, he loſes his likewiſe. But leſt Paſſion, Miſtakes, Flatteries, or the ill Deſigns of ſome about him, ſhould make him forſake his Zeal, and follow a deſtructive imaginary Intereſt, there is an Eſtate of Hereditary Nobility, who are by Birthright the Kingdom's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100711:26"/>
whoſe main Intereſt and Concern it is to keep the Ballance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſteady, that the Favourites and great Officers exceed not their Bounds, and oppreſs the People, that Juſtice be duly adminiſtred, and that all Parts of the Government be preſerved intire: yet even theſe may grow inſolent; a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to which great Men are liable, or may by Offices, Hopes of Preferment, or other Accidents, become (as to the Majority of them) rather the obſequious Flatterers of the Court, than true Supporters of the Publick and Engliſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Therefore the Excellency of our Government affords us another Eſtate of Men, which are the Repreſentatives of the Freeholders, Cities, Boroughs and Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> who by the old Law were to be choſen yearly, if not oftner, whereby they perfectly gave the Senſe of thoſe that choſe them, and did the ſame as if the Electors were preſent, coming ſo newly from them, and ſo quickly returning to give account of their Fidelity, under the Penalty of Shame and no further Truſt. Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons had been deſtroyed, 'twould have been impoſſible the Senſe of the Nation, and their Complaints, and the Grievances of the People ſhould have beer repreſented. To what Eſtate of Men muſt we have had Recourſe? Muſt it have been to the Nobility? It may be they might not have underſtood our Grievances, being in a Sphere above the Rank of Common People. And the Houſe of Commons being the Conſtitution, how could Money be raiſed to ſupport the Government without them, unleſs by a total Subverſion of the whole Frame of our Conſtitution? for by the Law the ſole Power of giving Money remains in the Houſe of Commons, none being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that but the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that would overthrow the Conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons, will not ſtick to ſubvert that of the Houſe of Lords, who are ſo eſſential a Part of the Government, that to part with them, was to part with the ſecond State, which is the Wiſdom and Counſel of the Nation, to which their Birth, Education, and conſtant Imployment in every Parliament being the ſame, fits and prepares them. I have read of a Houſe of Commons in the <hi>2d</hi> Parliament of <hi>Mary</hi> I. that was brib'd to conſent to the receiving and owning of the Pope's Power; but I never yet heard of a Houſe of Lords that were ſo bribed: and the Houſe of Lords in 1649 being voted uſeleſs, the Commons run into ſo many Factions, that put General <hi>Cromwell</hi> to the Neceſſity of taking upon him the Government of the Nation by a ſingle Perſon, by the Name and Title of <hi>Lord Protector.</hi> Thoſe who would deſtroy the Conſtitution of the Houſe of Lords, do endeavour the Deſtruction of the Ballance of the Engliſh Government.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, the King gives Life and Vigour to all the Proceedings in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Wills and Deſires of the People, tho approved by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, without the King ſignify nothing; unleſs he bids them be an Act, they are abortive. Therefore he that ſhall attempt the Subverſion of any of the other two Eſtates, is no more a King but a Tyrant, and uſeleſs to God and Man. You ſee that your Father undid himſelf to all Intents and Purpoſes, by following ſuch Meaſures as ſubverted his own Government; and ſo have you: and if you will not believe it, you may ask the French King, and he will ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you of the Matter. But from hence, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may ſee that you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100711:26"/>
any one Eſtate in this Government, but the whole is ſubverted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may lay down this Propoſition, that Parliaments are the Eſſential Part of the Government. In a word then, to conclude this Head, let me ask you or any of your Plotters theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If this be ſo, that by ſo great Authority <hi>(viz.</hi> ſo many Statutes then and now in Force, the Fundamentals of the Common Law, the Eſſentials of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> your Brother's Coronation-Oath, and ſo many Laws of God and Man) the Parliament ought to meet and ſit to redreſs Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, provide for Common Safety, eſpecially in times of Common Danger; and that this was ſo in a moſt eminent manner, none can doubt that did believe the King, ſo many Parliaments, the Cloud of Witneſſes, the publick Judicatures, their own Senſe and Experience of the manifold Miſchiefs acted, and the apparent Ruin and Confuſion that threatned the Nation by the reſtleſs Attempts of you and your bloody Party: Then, <hi>Sir,</hi> I ask you, Whether, after the People of <hi>England</hi> had the Point of the Dagger thus ſet to their Breaſts, and the Knife at their Throats, Cities and Habitations fired, Invaſions and Inſurrections threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſtroy the King and Government, your villanous Popiſh Party did not deſign to deſtroy the only Remedy hoped for, under God, to give us Relief, that is our Parliaments, who with ſo much Coſt and Pains were elected, ſent up, and intruſted for our Help, and to turn them off without anſwering the Ends for which choſen, by thoſe frequent Prorogations and Diſſolutions? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Point in hand: Were not the People of <hi>England</hi> juſtified in their important Cries, humble Petitions to the King your Brother, fervent Addreſſes to their Members, and earneſt Claims for this their Birthright, pleaded with all the Modeſty imaginable, which the Laws of the Kingdom (conſonant to the Laws of God and Nature) had given them? How impudent then were your Abhorrers of ſuch Petitions and Claims? What can <hi>Withens</hi> (who was expelled the Houſe for the ſame) ſay for himſelf? What can the Raſcal plead in behalf of himſelf and a raſcally Crew that joined with him in ſigning an Addreſs of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence; and that Villain <hi>Jefferies,</hi> who did that in <hi>London</hi> which <hi>Wythens</hi> had done in <hi>Weſtminſter?</hi> Which brings me to a ſecond Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If it be fo, that by ſo great Authority Parliaments ought to meet and ſit to redreſs Grievances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what ſhall we ſay to thoſe who adviſed your Brother to this high Violation of their Countries Rights, to the infringing ſo many juſt Laws, and to the expoſing the Publick to thoſe deſperate Hazards, even almoſt a total Ruine; which was done with all the Impudence and Barefacedneſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the Adviſers not having the leaſt Remorſe upon them?</p>
               <p>If K. <hi>Alfred</hi> (as <hi>Andrew Horne</hi> in his <hi>Mirror of Juſtice</hi> tells us) hanged <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Segnor, Cadwine, Cole,</hi> and forty Judges more for judging contrary to Law, and yet all thoſe faiſe Judgments were but in particular and private Caſes; what Death did thoſe deſerve who offer'd Violence to the Law it ſelf, and all the ſacred Rights of their Country?

was ſo ſolemnly ſworn to do? And if the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſillian</hi> was drawn, hang'd, and quartered, for adviſing the King to act contrary to ſome Statutes only, what did thoſe deſerve that adviſed your Brother to act, not only againſt ſome, but all the antient Laws and Statutes of the Realm?</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Sir,</hi> I would ſay this further to you, if you will have a little Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: If <hi>Blake</hi> the King's Counſel, only for aſſiſting in the Matter, and drawing up Indictments by the King's Command againſt Law (tho it's like he might plead the King's Order and Command for ſo doing) was drawn, hang'd and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; what was due to them that aſſiſted your Brother in the total Deſtruction of all the Laws of the Kingdom, and as much as in them lay, their King and Country too? And if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske</hi> the Under-Sheriff (whoſe Office it is to execute the Laws) for but endeavouring to aid <hi>Treſillian, Blake,</hi> and their Accomplices, againſt ſome of the Laws, was alſo with five more drawn, hang'd and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; what Puniſhment did they deſerve, that not only aided your Brother, but endeavour'd to ſubvert all the Laws of the Kingdom? And if <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. tho of the King's Privy Council, were hanged for procuring and executing an Act of Parliament contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and to the great Vexation of the People, when yet they had an Act of Parliament on their Side; what ought to have been done to thoſe who had no ſuch Act to ſhelter themſelves, and who not only acted contrary to, but to the Deſtruction of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom? I can expect, <hi>Sir,</hi> no Anſwer from you but this; The Men that did theſe things, ſhould ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have died; if they had been diſcovered, they ſhould have periſhed without Mercy. Is it ſo? then I come to the laſt Particular to be debated, and that is,</p>
               <p n="3">III. You are the Man, and your Party was the Party that did endeavour to break the Uſe of Parliaments by inveighing againſt that way of Government. In a word therefore I ſhall deſcend unto Particulars, and ſhew you, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That your Inclinations were not for Parliaments, or that Way of Governing. <hi>2ly.</hi> What thoſe Parliaments were that you and your Party procured to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. <hi>3ly.</hi> What Arts and Methods you uſed to expoſe the three laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments your Brother held in 1679, 1680, and 1681. <hi>4ly.</hi> Your Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſo doing. <hi>5ly.</hi> The ill Conſequences that attended the Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments. <hi>6ly.</hi> What Pretences you and your Party uſed for procuring the Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments, with Anſwers thereto.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> Your Inclinations ſhew'd you an Enemy to a Parliamentary Way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and this appears in the following Particulars: 1. From your Nature and Temper. 2. From your Uſage even of the Penſioner-Parliament. 3. From the Notions and Practices of your traiterous Party in relation to Parliaments. 4. From the daily Breaches you made upon our Laws. 5. By your Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to let that Parliament meet and ſit. 6. By the Opinion you had of their Affection to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From your own Nature and Temper, which I ſhall ſet forth before you, in relation to, (1.) Your Religion; (2.) Your Politicks; (3.) Your Morals.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Let us conſider your Nature and Temper in reſpect to your Religion, and this will prove your Averſion to Engliſh Parliaments, and that way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100711:27"/>
Your Nature and Temper inclined you to ſet up the Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How was this to be done? was it by an Engliſh Parliament? If any of your Party ſhould ſuppoſe this, let me tell you the Suppoſition in it ſelf was Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. Your Religion was ſuch (and I am perſwaded you are no Changeling) as went not altogether in the Old Primitive Apoſtolical Way of Preaching and Praying, and teaching all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Scourging, Wracking and Broil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men into the Fear of God. Nay, is not your Religion ſuch, that for its own Propagation it will make its Champions diveſt themſelves of Humanity, and act worſe than Devils, in order to be Saints? Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> where could you get a Parliament to have eſtabliſhed ſuch a Religion by a Law? And can any Man judg you in love with Parliaments, who are ſuch Enemies to this excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of yours? I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> reflect upon your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Words in his Letter to Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> the French King's Confeſſor<hi>: We have a mighty Work upon our Hands, no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps the utter ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſy, which hath domineered over great Part of this Northern World a long time: there were never ſuch Hopes of Succeſs ſince the Death of our Queen</hi> Mary <hi>as now in our Days;</hi> (What Reaſon gives <hi>Coleman</hi> for this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?) <hi>when,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God hath given us a Prince, who is become (I may ſay to a Miracle) zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious a Work: but the Oppoſition we are ſure to meet with is alſo like to be great, ſo that it imports us to get what Aid and Aſſiſtance we can; for the Harveſt is great, and the Labourers but few.</hi> Here was a mighty Work, and a mighty zealous Prince engaged in this Work. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> why did you not apply to your mighty Band of Penſioners in your Long Parliament for Aid and Aſſiſtance? No, your Religion would not comply with that, nor their Religion advance your mighty Work: tho they were Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains enough in ſome Senſe, yet you did not think fit to truſt them with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this mighty Work, or to let them know your mighty Mind and Zeal in this great Work. To whom then do you apply your ſelf? Why truly to the mighty <hi>Lewis,</hi> the French King: for do but obſerve your Agent's Words in the ſame Letter, where he ſaith; <hi>That which we rely upon moſt, next to Almighty God, and the Favour of my Maſter the Duke, is the mighty Mind of his Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe Soul inclines him to great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings.</hi> Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think the Caſe is plain, that the ſubtle Jeſuits had formed a Deſign to bring in Popery, and to kill the King, which they would never have been ſuch Sots to attempt, had they not been ſure you would engage in this mighty Work. Yet you were not privy to it: Let who will believe that, I cannot; for do you think the Jeſuits and <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> would have ingaged in that mighty part of the Converſion, had not they ſeen into your very Heart and Soul? Now upon the whole Matter, can any one think, if there were no ſuch thing in Nature as a mighty Engliſh Parliament to have joined with your mighty Zeal in the mighty Work you had upon your Hands, that ever the Religion which you profeſt would incline you to be in love with an Engliſh Parliament, that was ever averſe to Popery and Slavery ſince the Reformation? And becauſe of your Averſion to an Engliſh Parliament as an Enemy to your Religion, you apply your ſelf to the French King, which I am ſure was not conſiſtent with a hearty Love to an Engliſh Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Let us conſider your Nature and Temper as to your Politicks, and by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100711:28"/>
that I ſhall ſhew your natural Averſion to Parliaments, and a Parliamentary way of Government. As your Religion, ſo your Judgment leads you to Arbitrary Government: for it was not only <hi>Rome</hi>'s Religion, but the French Mode of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning that was your Deſign, and the end of all thoſe Counſels you had with your Jeſuits, and your Servant <hi>Coleman,</hi> who was a main Agent in that Affair; yet when your glorious Enterprize was diſcovered, you graciouſly left him to be hanged for all his good Secret Services done you in furthering the mighty Work you had upon your Hands.</p>
               <p>But ſome of your Party may ſay, That in oppoſition to a Parliament it was impoſſible to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power, it being inconſiſtent with the Rules of Policy to attempt ſuch a thing in <hi>England.</hi> To this I anſwer:</p>
               <p>Let the Popiſh Crew ſay ſo if they dare: I am certain they muſt bely their Conſciences in this point, whatever they do in other Points in their Politicks, the helliſh Popiſh Plot being a plain Demonſtration that your Cut-throat Papiſts did believe it poſſible, or elſe <hi>Coleman</hi> and others would not have on your Behalf ſo far engaged the French King's Aid and Aſſiſtance in the Affair: for you attempted to be reſtored to all your Commiſſions; and how came it to paſs that you did not effect your Reſtoration? It was not, ſaith <hi>Coleman,</hi> hindred by reaſon of any Averſion they had to your Perſon. What then? it was becauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction the Faction entertained againſt you. Who was this Faction but the Engliſh Parliament, to whom you were ſo averſe, that the Popiſh Party could make no brisk Attempt on your Behalf? for the Parliament then was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the French King's Intereſt was much attracted to yours, which declared you to be no Friend to them, and engaged them to provide for themſelves againſt you and your curſed Party.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Sir,</hi> by your leave, could any thing be plainer than the Deſign that <hi>Coleman</hi> and the Jeſuits had formed, and had Hopes of effecting, ſince they had joined you ſo cloſe to the French King's Intereſt? I am ſure 'twas contrary to Reaſon and Nature it ſelf for them to attempt your Brother's Life, and thereby commit the baſeſt of all Murders for Murder-ſake: and tho natural Affection might interpoſe in that Deſign, had you been privy to it, yet the Jeſuits well knew it was impoſſible for you that was converted to that degree of Zeal for the Romiſh Religion and French Intereſt, to have given ground in that Affair. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope your Villains here will be fully ſatisfied that it was poſſible for the Popiſh Party to carry on ſuch a Deſign as this in oppoſition to a Parliament, which is a great Proof of your Averſneſs to Parliaments.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſe to the Point, That your Nature and Temper, in relation to your Politicks, demonſtrated your Averſneſs to Engliſh Parliaments: the Jeſuits you know were very induſtrious with you for the Promotion of their Religion, which you conſented to; and what did you in order to this? Did you not lay ſome Foundations for Popery, in order to its being eſtabliſhed? Were there not Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and other Judiciary Officers of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, in order to deprave the Law of the Nation, and defile the Throne of Juſtice? I pray how did the villanous Judges uſe even the Proteſtant Laws, to open the firſt Gate to Slavery? and our Laws being in their Hands, did they not uſe them as barbarouſly as they could, to the Diſcouragement of Vertue,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100711:28"/>
and promoting Vice? Did not your Brother's Miniſters of State betray our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties? What Remedy had the People? If a Seſſion of Parliament was near, you ſo hated them upon this very Principle of Arbitrary Power, that either the Seſſion was put off for a longer time, or elſe it was to be ſo ſhort, that Grievances could not be redreſſed: and when you got a Period put to a Seſſion, your wicked Judges were to play their Parts with the Laws, whilſt your Miniſters were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing all our Liberties from us; and as for Religion, you had a Set of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Caterpillars, who were to manage that for your Service and Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Meaſures of yours taken from your Popiſh Crew, had rendred you ſo out of love to an Engliſh Parliamentary Government, that you were at one time looked upon by Parliament the greateſt Grievance of the Nation, the univerſal Object of their Hate and Fear, and the Subject of their Clamours and Curſes. At whoſe door did all the Diſcontents and Murmurs lie but at yours? Were not the Murmurs ſo violent againſt you, that they became a great part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of good Men to Heaven in their own and their Country's Behalf? Nay, Murmurs were ſo bold, that your Brother was attackt with them? for did they not look upon you as <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Stork amongſt the Frogs? Notwithſtanding all your former Glories and Conqueſts, your whole Stock of Fame was loſt, and buried in your Apoſtacy from the Proteſtant Religion. How all this, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love to your Country and its Government, could ſtand together, I leave to wiſer Men to judg. We ſaw you deſign'd to make us ſubmit to an Arbitrary Power: Our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was to have been deſtroyed by you and your Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats; our Religion and Liberties to have been aboliſhed; Popery and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Power ſet up; the Lords and Commons extirpated; and all to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into you, when they had given the fatal Blow, that you might have ſet up Idols and Molten Calves, and we have bowed down to them. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> conſider who the Man was that took ſuch Meaſures, and laid ſuch Deſigns; and if it were poſſible for him to love an Engliſh Proteſtant Parliament, I'll be his Slave.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Head, Did you not by theſe Politicks of yours fet the whole Kingdom in a Flame, and then pleaſe your ſelf with it? When you burnt our City, you and your Party ſung <hi>Te Deum</hi> for Joy, whilſt others were aſtoniſhed at the diſmal Sight. Did not your unbounded Thirſt for innocent Blood make the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> a Slaughter-houſe? And might you have had your Will, you would have made <hi>Smithfield</hi> your Original Shambles. It is well known, <hi>Sir,</hi> how you loved humane Sacrifices; and what Meaſures you took from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> to propagate your Cauſe, is not yet forgotten, nor I hope never will.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Let us conſider your Nature and Temper as to your Morals, from which we will demonſtrate your Diſaffection and Averſion to Parliaments. What Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality could we expect from you, that was and ſtill is a Papiſt, and a bigotted one too? And being ſo, all your Morals are but Slaves to your Zeal. Nay, had you been Maſter of all the Cardinal Vertues, there's not one but muſt have been uſed to deſtroy our Religion, Laws and Liberties. Your Fortitude and Courage (if ever you had any) made you the more daring to puſh on <hi>Rome</hi>'s Religion and the French Intereſt, and to withſtand the Oppoſition you met withal in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Your Juſtice you made uſe of to reſtore the Power and Authority of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100711:29"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> believing him to be Chriſt's lawful Vicar, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s true Succeſſor; and the ſaid Office including the Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it your Duty to give the Pope the ſame Right over the Conſciences of the People of <hi>England,</hi> as you had to ſucceed your Brother, tho through his Blood. Let us conſider, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Temperance, which for once I will ſuppoſe you to be Maſter of too, not for the publick Good, but only to teſtify that you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your Paſſions, which were great enough to do publick Miſchief, for you had always a moſt firm Reſolution to ruin theſe Kingdoms. As for your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, it was no more than fixed Obſtinacy. But it may be your Party may ſay, you were never heard to rage, or ſcarce ſeen to frown; how true that may be, I cannot tell, for I never was your Pimp, or Admirer, and therefore cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that Familiarity with you that ſome may. Yet what was your Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Conſtancy but fit Pillars to ſupport your damnable Deſigns againſt the Religion and Government of theſe three Kingdoms? But, <hi>Sir,</hi> if we ſhould again take a view of your admirable Temperance, in its larger Signification, that is, a Denial of worldly Deſires, it was ſtill worſe and worſe: for when you voluntarily took up your Croſs, and quitted your great Employments under your Brother, you left the Management of thoſe Offices to Villains of a deeper dye than the reſt of Mankind, who ſtill carried on your Deſign to deſtroy us; you only quitted the toil of the Power, and left it to your ſubordinate Villains. In the laſt place, we will comply with your Admirers and Flatterers, and own you had Prudence: if you had, it was the worſe for us, becauſe that, and that alone, could be your Trump-Gard, the only leading Vertue that managed your Conduct in all your Helliſh Plots and Deſigns with that Care and Art, that you made a fair Progreſs in effecting the Buſineſs of <hi>Rome</hi> as to Religion, and of the French King as to Arbitrary Power, to enſlave and pox us both in Religion and Liberty. To give you your due, you ripened that mighty Work you and <hi>Coleman</hi> had upon your Hands, to a mighty Perfection: and had it not met with a mighty Blaſt, you might by your ſuppoſed Prudence have ruined three mighty Kingdoms. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> if we grant you were endued with theſe mighty Vertues of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Temperance and Prudence, yet we muſt ſay they were the abſolute Hinges that open'd the Gates to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where Superſtition ruled the Day. Your moral Vertues were but leſſer Lights, that took their Light from that greater Orb above: but how theſe moral Vertues did ſhine in you, your old Friend <hi>Tom Jones</hi> (if alive) could plainly tell, for he knew your Vertues very well, even to his dying Day.</p>
               <p>I muſt mind you of one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> your Oath of Alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iance that you took to your Brother as your Sovereign Lord. Did you keep that Oath to him? If you did, ſurely the only Motive that prompted you was ſome Obligation you believed was in the Oath. But pray tell me, did not you Apoſtacy to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not only require a Renunciation of that Oath, but alſo abſolve you from the Ties of it? Therefore I ask you again, Could your Conſpiracy with the French King againſt our Laws and Liberties conſiſt with that Oath? Or if you look'd upon your ſelf releaſed from it, pray what Security could the Government have, when you ſhould come to the Crown, that you would keep your Faith with an Heretical People, that would not keep Faith and true Allegiance to your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100711:29"/>
Brother, who was of the ſame Religion with your ſelf? This, <hi>Sir,</hi> was your Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of which your Party ſo much boaſted. And how the Exerciſe of theſe Vertues, that were ſo uſed in the Drudgery of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> could be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with an Engliſh Parliamentary Government, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Conſideration of your Nature and Temper in all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſhews you were a Perſon in whom it was impoſſible there could be any love for Parliaments. Let your Party ſay what they will, and boaſt of your Vertues till doomſday, yet I muſt ſay that your Nature and Temper ſhewed you a Man of no good Morals, your Conſcience being ready at all times to tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate as you found occaſion. Thoſe near you, that underſtood the Pulſe of your Opinion, did not in the leaſt doubt your Heart, which (whilſt you profeſt to be a Proteſtant) conveyed Symptoms of Inflammation againſt the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe it was not ſo ready to conſume a Party of Men you hated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Maxim of your deareſt Great Grandmother of notorious Memory, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots; to which purpoſe you zealouſly promoted about the time of your Brother's Reſtoration, abundance of Church-Caterpillars, that with the fierceſt Wrath might devour thoſe of the Reformed Religion: nay, how often did you fall upon theſe Vermin, as not zealous enough in perſecuting thoſe that differed from them only in a few raſcally Ceremonies, not worthy of wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Porter's Breech? by which means thoſe baſe Creatures ruined ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Families in the ſpace of twenty odd Years, and brought them to great want. And for all the Pretences you ever made for Liberty of Conſcience, you uſed to diſcover to your Brother the Ardency of your Zeal againſt poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants, and the Moderate Church-men, that they were the greateſt Enemies againſt his Government; and for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they would not part with their Religion as Chriſtians, nor their Liberties as Engliſh-Men, but preſerve both chaſt and inviolable, that they might approve themſelves Men of Uprightneſs before God and Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your Inclinations publiſhed you an Enemy of all Parliaments, from your Uſage of that very Parliament in which you had ſuch a Band of Penſioners. One would think you ſhould never have parted with ſuch a Parliament, where you and your Villains had purchaſed ſuch an Intereſt: truly ſome of them were ſo fond to aid and abet the Deſtruction of the Nation, that the Charges in their Elections were defrayed, whatever they amounted to; any ſome of them were ſo profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, that as they had no Eſtates, ſo they had neither Conſcience nor Honour, but were ſuch as you pick'd out as neceſſary Men, whoſe Votes you moſt relied upon. You procured Tables for many of them at <hi>Whitehall</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and had them for their great Loyalty in their Votes received into Penſion. What vaſt Sums did they give? a great part of which was by you obtained to carry on your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes: And what Sums did you obtain to carry on your firſt wicked War againſt the Dutch, and to ſupply your extraordinary Occaſions in the ſecond? How well they ſupplied the Neceſſities of the Court-Whores, Pimps and Bawds, is well known. You no ſooner demanded, but they complied; ſo that your Brother and you once thought your ſelves exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy in a Houſe of Commons: notwithſtanding the Exchequer was ſhut up, and by a Proclamation that you procured, the Crown was publiſhed a Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100711:30"/>
in the midſt of ſo many Aids and Revenues given by them. Yet what hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Slaves were theſe to you and your Intereſt, that when you ought to have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Publick Juſtice of the Nation due to Traitors, they not only paſſed by all your Miſcarriages, but ſtood by you as far as they durſt: and tho your Sins cried aloud, yet nothing moved them to call you to an account for them. If your Brother asked, they gave, till even they themſelves were near the point of becoming uſeleſs, and their Penſions too in danger. In recompence of this you aimed at their Diſſolution; and how you branded them in a certain Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration drawn up by <hi>Coleman</hi> by your Privity, (which your Brother had promiſed to ſign, but not being a Slave to his Word, did not) is yet remembred.</p>
               <p>In that Declaration you charge the Houſe of Commons (that had given your Brother ſuch Teſtimonies of their Loyalty and Bounty) with miſconſtruing all his Endeavours to preſerve the Nation in Eaſe and Proſperity, and againſt all Reaſon and Evidence repreſented them to the Nation as Arguments of Fear and Diſquiet; and that under pretence of ſecuring Property and Religion, they had demanded unreaſonable things from the Crown, to bring thoſe Men that had ſo well ſerved your Brother and you, out of all Eſteem with the Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. You declared them Enemies to Liberty of Conſcience, and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Government; and that they made ſeditious Conſtructions of the ſame, and many other Charges of a very high Nature, eſpecially for oppoſing your Match with Mrs. <hi>Modena</hi> your Italian Comrade. Nay, you charg'd them for being Enemies to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore you laboured to the utmoſt to have them diſſolved, tho you well knew that if theſe poor Dogs were not in a Parliament, they muſt be in a Priſon. If this were your uſage of a Parliament, in which you were ſo happy, if we may believe the King's Meſſage to the Commons, <hi>Feb.</hi> 28. 1663. what can any Man judg from hence but this, that if this Parliament could not pleaſe you, none could? This I think ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrates what Inclination you had for any Parliament; for certain you nor your raſcally Party could never expect to ſee a Parliament more ready to aſſiſt you in all your wicked Deſigns.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Inclination to Parliaments was ſeen by the Notions and Practices of your Party in relation to Parliaments, eſpecially from thoſe of them that knew you beſt. Were not <hi>Coleman, Beddingfield, Whitebread, Strange, Nevil,</hi> and ſeveral other Villains, of your Privy Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s? and did not theſe ſtudy to find out your Inclinations, and to imitate you exactly? And how theſe and the reſt of your villanous Crew ſtood affected to Parliaments in general, is not yet forgotten by ſome that knew them. Was it not their common diſcourſe, that they hoped there would be no more need of Parliaments? did not your Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits go from Coffee-houſe to Coffee-houſe, and ridicule Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> this was but the Copy which your Villains took from your own Words; who ſometimes, when they wanted a Supply for their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions, would be ſeemingly content that a Parliament ſhould meet and ſit to raiſe ſuch a Supply, but never to redreſs Grievances: nay, ſome of them have ſaid that a King's Proclamation ought to be ſufficient to raiſe Money, and that it would never be well with us till the whole Government was reduced to the Model of that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100711:30"/>
               <p n="4">4. Your Inclinations to a Parliament were ſeen in your daily Breaches upon the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Kingdom. You knew the Parliament had made an Act of Uniformity, and ſeveral Laws againſt Diſſenters in 1663, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws were made againſt Papiſts in former Kings Reigns; yet to oblige the Popiſh Party, you broke in upon all theſe Laws at once, and procured your Brother in the ſaid Year to put forth an Indulgence for tender Conſciences, not for the Encouragement of Proteſtant Diſſenters, but the Increaſe and Growth of Popery. And as a neceſſary thing to uſher in your ſecond wicked War againſt the Dutch, you put your Brother upon iſſuing forth another Declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in 1671. Many other Inſtances I could give of this Matter, but this ſhall ſuffice. Now how this could conſiſt with an innate Love to Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I muſt leave to better Judgments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your Inclinations to Parliaments were ſeen in your Unwillingneſs to let that Parliament meet and ſit, in which you had ſo great a Band of Penſioners. To my certain Knowledg Meſſenger after Meſſenger has been ſent to <hi>France</hi> with begging Letters, to get Money from the French King to put off the Sitting of the Parliament. Give your Brother his due, he never cared for their Sitting, unleſs it was to get a Supply, that he might exerciſe his Talent you know where, without Moleſtation, which he could not well do at a Seſſion of Parliament. <hi>Sir,</hi> when the Parliament was by Prorogation to have met in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672/3, O what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was uſed to put it off till <hi>October</hi> following? and it had been done, if your Party had brought in a Million as they promiſed; but bringing in but 356000 <hi>l.</hi> there was no help but a Parliament muſt meet; who I think made up the Defect in the Supply you expected from the Popiſh Party. You know the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was put off from <hi>Octob.</hi> 1670, till <hi>Feb.</hi> 1672/3. by which long Interval you had a competent Scope for the mighty Work you had upon your Hands, that you and the reſt of the Architects of our Ruine might be ſo long free from their odious and buſy Inſpection, till it were finiſhed. A drinking Companion of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's telling you that the Seſſion of Parliament drew near, and asking you what you thought of the Humour the Parliament-men would be in at next Seſſion? you anſwered, you truſted there might be no Occaſion for their meeting any more, for you had hopes to bring the Cauſe to bear without a Parliament; and took it as a great Affront that the Queſtion was asked. You know the old Squire your Brother laughed at you for that Capricio of yours, tho your Jeſuits thought it a piece of Impudence in that Gentleman ſo much as to mention the name of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in your Preſence, he knowing your Opinion as to that way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I muſt conclude that Man to be at a perpetual War with Mankind, that will not admit of the ſight of either Friends or Enemies. If, <hi>Sir,</hi> you could not bear the Congreſs of your Friends that had been ſo loyal and bountiful, you muſt certainly be averſe to the meeting of a Parliament, that would call you and your wicked Party to account for your many traiterous Deſigns againſt our Laws and Liberties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Your Inclination to Parliaments was ſeen in your Opinion of the Affection which your Band of Penſioners did bear to you and your Cauſe. You know, <hi>Sir,</hi> you had put your ſelf under the Protection of the French King, and therefore it was ſcarce poſſible for you to engage any more in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100711:31"/>
a Parliamentary way, for all Engliſh Parliaments are haters of the French Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Your Friend <hi>Coleman</hi> in his Letter to <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> Sept. 29. ſays, <hi>That in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Ferier<hi>'s time he had inculcated the great danger the Catholick Religion and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would be in at the next Seſſion of Parliament, which was to be in</hi> Oct, 1673. <hi>at which I fore ſaw that the King my Maſter would be forced to do ſomewhat in Prejudice to his Alliance with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; which I ſaw ſo evidently, and particularly that we ſhould make Peace with</hi> Holland, <hi>that I urged all the Arguments I could, which to me were Demonſtrations to convince your Court of that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and preſſed all I could to perſwade his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to uſe his utmoſt Endeavours to prevent that Seſſion of our Parliament.</hi> Again, you find him preſſing him for the Diſſolution of the Parliament, in order to bring the Confederates to a Peace upon the French King's Terms. Then he plainly tells you, <hi>That the Parliament, as it was managed by the then Miniſtry, was both unuſeful to</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>and the Catholick Religion.</hi> In another Part he tells you, <hi>That Prorogations were but loſs of time, and a means to ſtrengthen thoſe who oppoſed the Crown;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill preſſes for a Diſſolution, <hi>which would give the Proteſtant Religion the greateſt Blow that ever it receiv'd ſince its firſt Birth.</hi> So that we may ſee by your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> what Opinion you had of the then Parliament. But that we may rivet the Matter, I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> take but a Note or two of your own Letter to <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> wherein you expreſs your ſelf extreamly pleaſed, <hi>That the French King was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the unuſefulneſs of the Parliament in order to the Service of the King your Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</hi> In another place you ſay, that <hi>his Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was of Opinion that the Parliament was neither in his Intereſt nor yours.</hi> Pray let me know what Parliament would be in your Intereſt joined to that of the French King: Shew me ſuch a Parliament, and I will then ſay I can ſhew you one that you would have a good Opinion of: and ſince you could retain no good Opinion of your Band of Penſioners, you can certainly have none of thoſe that are for preſerving the Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt. So that I think I have ſufficiently ſhewed your Inclinations, and by them your Enmity to Parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> I now come to ſhew what thoſe Parliaments were to which you were ſo averſe, and which you procured to be diſſolved, whereby your hatred to Parliaments, and that way of Government, did appear. Were they Men of Common-wealth-Principles, or did they aim at the Promotion of their own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Greatneſs? did you or your Rogues know of ſuch Perſons? why then did you not diſcover them? The Nation would have charged the Account to themſelves, and have made your Party ſome recompence for ſo ſignal a Piece of Service to the Publick. Nay, if your Crew had brought theſe People to light, and let the Parliament ſat to have toſſed them in a Blanket, they would have found a little ſeverer quarter, than the Mayor of <hi>Scarborough</hi> did from one of your Apoſtles, whom you ſent to plant a Colony of Red-coat-Chriſtians in that Place. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> in plain Engliſh your Common-wealth-Chriſtians we found were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men that were in a moſt zealous manner devoted to the publick Good and common Service of their Country, who believed Kings were inſtituted for the Good of their People, and Government ordained for the ſake of the Governed, and therefore complained or were grieved when it was uſed to contrary ends. Every wife and honeſt Man would then and ſtill be proud to be of that Rank and Number.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100711:31"/>
And if Common-wealth ſignifies <hi>Common Good,</hi> in which ſenſe it has been taken in all Ages by moſt good Authors; as <hi>Bodin,</hi> ſpeaking of the Government of <hi>France,</hi> calls it a Common-wealth, as do our own Authors (the <hi>Mirrour of Juſtice, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton, Fleta, Forteſcue,</hi> &amp;c.) in former times, as well as thoſe of later Years, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and not only ſeveral Statutes uſe the word <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> but K. <hi>James</hi> your Grandfather in his firſt Speech to an Engliſh Parliament own'd himſelf the Servant of the Common-wealth; and K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. your deareſt Father of famous Memory, both before and in the time of the War, never expreſt himſelf otherwiſe: to be fond then of ſuch Common-wealth Principles becomes every good Engliſh Man, and the whole Kingdom were glad to find they had ſent ſuch Men to Parliament. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Villains uſed to call thoſe Parliaments, which you procured to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, Perſons conſpiring to ſet up a Democratical Power in oppoſition to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, that would overthrow the Government both in Church and State, tho it was that which you and your Rogues deſigned in that villanous Alliance you made with <hi>France</hi> to deſtroy the King and the Proteſtant Religion. The Nation ſaw it was not thoſe they had ſent up to Parliament, but you that had a Deſign to overthrow the Government; for you were ſo fond of your beloved Arbitrary Power, and therefore reſolved to ſubvert our legal Monarchy inſtituted for the Benefit of the Common-wealth, by deſtroying the Honour and Reputation of our Engliſh Parliaments.</p>
               <p>I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> call to mind the Band of Penſioners you had in that Parliament which your Brother kept ſo long; yet you could not bear with their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt your Party, when your Deſigns were laid open before them, and ſo plainly proved, that they could not withhold Juſtice from being executed upon ſeveral of your Caſe-hardned Traitors. When they were diſſolved, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that three greater Parliaments were never known in <hi>England</hi> ſince the time of <hi>William</hi> I: than what ſucceeded them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe two that met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that at <hi>Oxford;</hi> they were, I dare ſay, the Flower of the whole Kingdom, and might with all Juſtice be termed the Wiſdom of the Nation: their Debates and Votes which were printed and publiſhed, ſhewed them to be Gentlemen of very great Ability and Integrity; thoſe that ſent them knew them to be Perſons of great Eſtates, not beggarly Raſcals, ſuch as were in your Penſionary Parliament, that had betrayed us to you and your Party in a great meaſure: theſe did not pleaſe you, becauſe they would not perpetrate ſo great a Piece of Villany; how then could thoſe pleaſe you that met together afterwards, and approv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Well-wiſhers to the Proteſtant Religion, and duly conſider'd the State of the Nation, and the many Dangers to which it was expoſed by you and your Villains? Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> if any one can inform me how all this doth not prove you an Enemy to the Conſtitution of Parliaments, let him come forth, and he ſhall be heard; or let us know what ſort of Men you are inclined to, for I believe if you could obtain 513 Papiſts, that were not of the French Intereſt, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Popery ſeparate from Arbitrary Power, even ſuch could not pleaſe you, but would ſoon be expoſed as others have been: and if you ſhould have met with 513 Men, that could have complied with you in both, you muſt have met with ſuch as would have deſtroyed their own Conſtitution, and put a Period to all

                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Remember what Arts and Methods you and your Party uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the three laſt Parliaments your Brother held in 1679, 1680, 1681. It is worth your conſidering that when you had a great deſire to have the long Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament diſſolved, ſome objected, that if that was diſſolved, the Crown was in danger, becauſe a new one was to be called. But thoſe that made the Objection, did not conſider a new one muſt be choſen; which if they did, yet they did not conſider what the Men were that would in all probability be choſen: and thoſe new Parliaments, if they might have been ſuffered to redreſs Grievances, would have ſtuck at nothing to have rendred themſelves acceptable both to Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for it was, firſt, the beſt way your Brother took to become acquainted with the Nation, to diſſolve that Parliament that had ſo long continued. Secondly, the King might, if he would have let his Parliaments ſat, obtained a great Sum of Money for Payment of his Debts; nay, they would have given it him as a Pledg of Endearment between him and the People; they reſolved to give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hoped he would receive as graciouſly: in truth, <hi>Sir,</hi> they would have been generous even to your ſelf, for they would have excluded you from being King, that you might enjoy the greater Security of your Perſon and Eſtate as a Subject, which if you would have believed, you had not at this day been rattling your Beads at St. <hi>Germains:</hi> the People would have been free under their King, as the King would have been happy in his People; and both ſecured by frequent Parliaments, which therefore could never endanger your Brother's Crown. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not your ſelf, nor think that we could be cheated with that Nonſenſe; for nothing could endanger his Crown but your advancing the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Arbitrary Power of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> It was theſe things endanger'd your Brother's Government, nothing elſe could: but, good Gentleman, he was engaged with you in theſe things beyond recovery, to the ruin of himſelf, and the endangering of all our Laws and Liberties.</p>
               <p>The Devil's Brokers did not join with you in diſſolving the Long Parliament, but cried out, if that Parliament was diſſolved, the Church would fall: but, <hi>Sir,</hi> I will ſay that for you, you had as little regard for the Church as you could, conſidering how the Rogues had eſpouſed your Quarrel, and thought that Paſſive-Obedience, Nonreſiſtance, and the Divine Right of Succeſſion would have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Orv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Alas, alas, the poor diſtreſſed Church, and the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Band of Penſioners! For the latter, they were a Parcel of matchleſs Villains, and ſhe Whore enough not to be in the Nation's Intereſt: but diſſolved they were, and what eſcaped the Jail, were ſecured by the Friars; thoſe who had ſtood by the Intereſt of their Country, were ſent again, and ſuch a Set of Gentlemen as no King would have ſent home in ſo ignominious a manner but your Brother at your procurement; and being ſent home, you and your Party made it your Buſineſs to expoſe them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You had them expoſed on your Stages, in your raſcally Play-houſes, by a Parcel of mercenary Rogues and Whores, who you and your villanous Party ſet up to debauch the Nation, and to ridicule the eſſential Parts of the Government,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100711:32"/>
as if the Votes and Debates of that Auguſt Aſſembly were to be ridiculed by ſuch Vermine, who were Tools you made uſe of in ſome part to do your Drudgery. But ſtay, it is not fit the Whores that are Stage-players ſhould be reflected on, left there ſhould be a more ſevere Act made for cutting of Noſes; for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Man, you know, had his Noſe cut for ſpeaking againſt that ſort of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: but I will not be afraid to mention their contemptuous reproaching of Parliaments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You had Monſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> who managed the Intrigue of charging the principal leading Members of both Houſes of thoſe three Parliaments with being in a Conſpiracy againſt your Brother and your ſelf; and this he, and your Jeſuits, Prieſts, and other Vermine contrived by Subornation and Perjury, a Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not unuſual to ſome Perſons and Courts: all the Miſchiefs, Poiſonings and Villanies in all the European Courts, were owing chiefly to his and his Maſter's moſt Chriſtian Politicks: he was uſed as a main Agent fit to expoſe three as great Parliaments as <hi>England</hi> ever knew, to all the Courts of Chriſtendom, as a Confederacy of Men in a Plot to deſtroy the King and your ſelf, and as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Monarchy. And what was this but to render Parliaments odious to all the Princes of <hi>Europe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding thoſe three Parliaments had nothing before them but to ſecure the Government againſt the Depredations that Popery and Arbitrary Power would have made upon it; and notwithſtanding their great Duty to the King, yet what a ſcandalous Declaration was emitted, wherein the ſaid Parliaments were moſt villanouſly treated, as if they had aimed at nothing but the change of the Government? This Declaration may be ſuppoſed to be drawn by that Villain, the French Ambaſſador, in his own Mother-Tongue, becauſe tho it was turned into Engliſh, yet the French way of wording it ſhews there was a French Counſellor in the caſe, which could be none but he, who was the chief Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor your Brother and you uſed in the management of your Conſpiracy; yet it is but the Copy of your Grandfather's and Father's way of Proceeding, which your Brother and you thought fit to uſe to aſperſe Parliaments; you were all Friends alike to that Conſtitution of the Engliſh Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is very remarkable, that your villanous Judges were inſtructed in their Circuits to ſpit their Venom againſt the Proceedings of the ſaid Parliaments; and in their reſpective Stations they were to let their Grand Juries know what reaſon the King had to diſſolve them: and how they recommended the King's moſt Gracious Declaration to their Conſideration, and what Converts they made, I was never curious to inquire; for I could not ſuppoſe but the Country knew the Men, and their Character, and under what neceſſity they lay to be Villains, from the tenour of their illegal Commiſſions, and that they muſt proſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Will of the Court, or be diſmiſſed from their Imployments: but they choſe rather to be Scandals to the Bench, than to appear as ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to their Profeſſions at the Bar. Upon all which Conſiderations I cannot believe they ever made any farther Profelytes againſt the Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than a paltry Sheriff of a County, or a villanous Grand Jury, pack'd on purpoſe to draw up an Addreſs of Thanks for the Court's attempting to ruin the Government as eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>

Since, <hi>Sir,</hi> the City of <hi>London</hi> could not be debauched, but the eminent Merchants and Traders in it ſtood firm to their Laws and Liberties, and to the Government of <hi>England</hi> by Parliaments, ſo that you could not influence the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, you took an unheard-of Courſe to debauch the Servants and Apprentices in their Morals, and procured a Day of Feaſting for them, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. You imployed old <hi>Hodg,</hi> your Buffoon in ordinary, to write againſt the Proceedings of thoſe Parliaments: the Rogue by his Lies, Equivocations and Prevarications, did much Miſchief, having called in a parcel of little Prieſts, who engaged themſelves to rail at Parliaments, and admire the Loyalty of old <hi>Hodg</hi> their Guide, whoſe <hi>Obſervators</hi> were the Subjects of their Diſcourſes every Lord's day; nay, they would ſcarce look upon a Sacramental Diſcourſe, the firſt Sunday in the Month, to be well diſh'd up, unleſs ſome of <hi>Roger</hi>'s Frippery was mingled with it: ſo that the old Villain was not unſucceſsful in his traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Papers which he publiſhed ſeveral times a week, till God in his Mercy open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eyes of ſome of our Paſſive-Obedience-Puppies, and let them ſee the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was aiming at Popery, and deſtroying the Church of <hi>England,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſpecious Pretences to defend it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You had your ſpiritual Myrmidons throughout the Kingdom, roaring from their Pulpits againſt the Proceedings of thoſe Parliaments, by the Inſtruction of ſome of their Superiours: this by the help of new Matter the Court inſtructed them in, laſted ſeveral years; ſo that they were rather Court-Agents to carry on ſome deſign, than Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God. But alas, when the Tithe-pig began to ſqueak, they turned their Diſcourſes another way. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give the pious Herd of your Eccleſiaſtical Swine their due, they will do any thing to ſerve you, if they can but enjoy their Swill and Grains; poor Wretches, I never met with any of them that would loſe a Meal to ſave either King or Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You had your Raſcals in the moſt publick Coffee-houſes, who ſpent their time chiefly in railing at Parliaments, that they were unuſeful, and were bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 40 and 41 again upon the Stage; that they had a Deſign to ruin the King by giving no Money, and ſtarving his Servants: nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> they were ſo inſolent as to offer all Indignity to thoſe Gentlemen that had ſerved in any of thoſe Parliaments; for doing of which they were not only incouraged by your Grace and Favour in your Smiles, but were alſo well rewarded. The Particulars might be ſet down, but I leave them to reply upon thoſe that ſhall pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this or any part of it, provided they put their Names to their Anſwer, as I have done to this my Memorial, otherwiſe I ſhall not take notice of any Scribler in your Party. You have your Friend <hi>Sherridan,</hi> one of your Devil's Brokers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and honeſt <hi>Togra Smith</hi> another excellent Partiſan of yours; nay,

you have a Set of Caſe-hardned Villains, that would if they durſt be barking at the Government; the Rogues ſtand ſtill for want of Buſineſs: I pray give them orders to diſprove any part of the truth of what I now write; if you do, you have a notorious Rogue, the <hi>Quondam</hi> Bp. of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> that walks in your <hi>Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Park of St. <hi>James</hi>'s; he is ſtill a Malignant, and hates our Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: you would do well to ſend for him, for he would be a main Champion with you in the Caſe of governing by Parliaments.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeized every good Man, to ſee two of the greateſt Parliaments <hi>England</hi> ever knew diſſolved within the ſpace of three Months. I confeſs the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have in a great meaſure been intruſted by the Kingdom with appointing the times of the Sitting and Diſſolving of Parliaments: but leſt thro' defect of Age, Experience, or Underſtanding, they ſhould forget or miſtake our Conſtitution, or by Paſſion, private Intereſt, or the Influence of evil Counſellors be ſo far miſled, as not to aſſemble Parliaments when the publick Affairs require it, or ſhould declare them diſſolved before the Ends of their Meeting were accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Wiſdom of our Forefathers has provided divers Laws both for holding Parliaments annually, and oftner if need be, and that they ſhould not be put off till all the Bills were paſſed, all Petitions anſwered, and Grievances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What Precedent can be produced for ſuch a Diſſolution amongſt our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records in Parliament, held in the times of our antient Engliſh Kings? We are taught by the Writ of Summons that Parliaments are never called without the Advice of the Council; and the uſage of all Ages has never been to ſend them away without the ſame Advice. Now if theſe Methods of calling and diſmiſſing Parliaments were ſafe, then not to purſue them, was to expoſe the King to the Cenſures and Reflections of the whole Nation for an Action not only illegal and uncuſtomary, but alſo very ungrateful to the People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have not the Laws of the Land taken great care to make the King always dear to the People, and to preſerve his Perſon ſacred in their Eſteem, by wiſely preventing his appearing in any Action that may be unacceptable to them? Now was the Diſſolution of three Parliaments, nay four in the compaſs of 26 Months, acceptable to the People? Ought you not then to have uſed your Intereſt with him to have acted according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of Parliaments, which would have rendred you both acceptable to the People? And had he given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leaſure to have had this debated in Council, becauſe then his Counſellors muſt have anſwered for their Advice, you and your Brother had remained Honourable in the Eyes of the Nation, and not have been judged guilty of ſuch Orders as were not only irregular, but alſo very illegal.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100711:34"/>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe you ſhould ſay, the King commanded it to be done, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were bound to obey, and therefore are juſtified: yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me tell you that the Miniſters that adviſed and aſſiſted in the Adminiſtration of Affairs, could not juſtify an unlawful Action under Colour of the King's Commands, ſince all his Commands contrary to Law were in themſelves void; which is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that old Maxim in the Law, <hi>That the King can do no wrong;</hi> a Maxim not only true in ſelf, but ſafe for a Prince and Subject too: for certainly it was Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe in your Brother's Favourites to think of excuſing their many Enormities under pretence of their Maſter's Command. The truth is, it was ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Privy Council was ignorant of the thing, and ſurpriſed at it, not being worthy to be truſted with it: but the French Whore near St. <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe had the News of the Parliament's being to be diſſolved two days before we knew of it at <hi>Oxford;</hi> ſo that it was a Work of darkneſs concerted between <hi>Barillon</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and the King reſolved upon it by their Advice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Would it not have been unreaſonable in your Brother and you to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the 12 Judges from ſitting in Term-time, and from going the ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, that Juſtice and Judgment might not be done? Now that Parliaments ſhould meet and ſit for Redreſs of Grievances, and making good and wholeſome Laws, by the ſame Sacred Tie whereby at his Coronation he obliged himſelf to let his Judges ſit to diſtribute Juſtice every Term, and in both the Seaſons of the Year in their Circuits, and to preſerve inviolably all the Rights and Liberties of the People, is very evident. Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> abruptly to diſſolve Parliaments, when nothing but the Legiſlative and united Wiſdom of the Kingdom could relieve the Proteſtant Party from their juſt Fears, or ſecure their Religion from its certain Dangers, is very inconſiſtent with the great Truſt repoſed in your Brother, and ſeems to expreſs but little of that Love and Tenderneſs which the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might juſtly have expected from him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Would not the Conſtitution of Parliament, as by the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed, have been equally imperfect, and deſtructive of it ſelf, had it been left to the Arbitrary Will of a wicked King, whether he would ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a Parliament, or had it been put into his Power to diſmiſs them at his pleaſure, or at the Pleaſure of two raſcally French Whores, or a little ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel French Ambaſſador? And therefore was not your Brother's diſſolving the Parliaments at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> by your procurement, a moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Was not the Kingdom ſo alarm'd at the Wickedneſs of your Brother in diſſolving thoſe Parliaments, that Men began to be exceedingly concerned, not knowing where it would end; inſomuch that your Brother was neceſſitated in a ſneaking Declaration to let the Nation ſee he was conſcious to himſelf that his Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments ſtood in need of an Apology; ſo that it was but at the beſt an Appeal from his Parliament to the People of <hi>England?</hi> And if your Brother and you could not juſtify your Uſage of theſe Parliaments, becauſe ſo deſtructive to the Liberty of the Subject, what aſſurance did your two French Whores <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and <hi>Barillon</hi> give you and the reſt of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that your Brother's Declaration, ſhewing Reaſons for ſuch a Violation to our Engliſh Government, would make the Nation in love with ſuch Treatments
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100711:34"/>
of their Repreſentatives? For, <hi>Sir,</hi> could you think in your Conſcience that the People of <hi>England</hi> did not ſee themſelves hereby expoſed to the reſtleſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their Enemies, and reſented it highly, ſince they could not but be ſenſible of the languiſhing Condition of the three Kingdoms, and that nothing but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could cure the Diſtempers with which we were infected by you and your Party, both as to Religion and Morals? And had they not with great Charge and Difficulty choſen three Parliaments, on whom they placed their Hopes? And thoſe being ſuddenly diſſolved, could they believe your Brother or you deſigned any thing leſs than a total Subverſion of the Government? Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſit down, put on your Iriſh conſidering Cap, and judg why ſince <hi>Ned Coleman</hi>'s Proteſtant Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was ſo unhappily publiſhed before its time, the Nation ſhould not be as much alarmed at <hi>Barillon</hi>'s Declaration in <hi>April</hi> 1681, as they were at <hi>Coleman</hi>'s in 1678. And could you and your Iriſh Teagues imagine that one French Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould ſo ſoon ſucceed another? nay, could you, without being confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſee your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Original (fairly drawn by the Advice of the French King's Confeſſor, to bring in Popery and Slavery) ſo much outdone by <hi>Barillon</hi>'s Copy, ſince you judged it could never be outdone by any Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? And ſince the former expoſed you and your Brother as the worſt of Men, how could you expect the latter ſhould not have the ſame effect upon the Engliſh Nation, and put them into ſuch a Ferment, as to deal by you and your Party juſt as we did in 1688?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Did not your Brother, <hi>April</hi> 20. 1679, not only in Council, but Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, declare <hi>how ſenſible he was of the ill Poſture of his Affairs, and the great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Diſſatisfaction of his good Subjects, whereby the Crown and Government was become too weak to preſerve it ſelf; which proceeded from his uſe of a ſingle Miniſtry, and of private Advices; and therefore profeſſed his Reſolution to lay them wholly aſide for the future, and to be adviſed by thoſe able and worthy Perſons whom he had choſen for his Council in all his weighty and important Affairs?</hi> Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> conſider, was it not moſt unreaſonable in you and your French Vermine to put the King upon ſuch a manifeſt Violation of his Royal Word and Promiſe to the Nation? But to put the Matter out of diſpute, Did not your Brother, on that Choice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, tell the Parliament of his Reſolution of meeting his People often in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And who was it that changed his mind, and made him alter thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Purpoſes, but you and your wicked Party? Would you make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that your Brother could ſo ſoon forget his Promiſes, or that upon the meeting of theſe Parliaments there were no weighty Matters to be debated?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Did not you and your Party, in prevailing with the King, ſhew the World, that your Cunning kept not pace with your Malice, ſince by this wicked uſage of our Repreſentatives in thoſe Parliaments you and your Cutthroats made your ſelves known, tho you had ſecretly and cautiouſly given that wicked Advice to your Brother, only to be protected from the publick Juſtice of the Nation? But in time you diſcovered your ſelves, and told your own Names, when Caſe-hardned enough to pull off the Mask, and let us ſee what you would be at. But what Offence did you take at thoſe Parliaments? Surely it was becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Treaſons and traiterous Deſigns of you and your Conſpirators rendred you obnoxious to them. And did you not put the King upon diſſolving thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100711:35"/>
Parliaments, thinking thereby not to have been judged the Authors of that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Counſel? Alas, good <hi>Sir,</hi> you have ſo expoſed your ſelf in that Matter, that you left your ſelf and Party not only without Juſtification, but without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence hereafter; but thanks be to God, I lived to ſee the Juſtice of the Nation take place upon you, and ſome of your Party. There are ſome yet lurking, and basking themſelves in good Imployments; but I hope our King will rid himſelf of the Vermine in time. I am confident, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may reflect upon theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and pronounce your ſelf guilty of this unreaſonable Uſage of three as great Parliaments as ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw. Now how can we conclude otherwiſe, than that you then was, and ſtill continue an Enemy to Parliaments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> The ill Conſequences attending the Diſſolution of thoſe three Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are worthy your Conſideration: and that I may be brief herein, take notice;</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Diviſions you and your Party cauſed amongſt the People of <hi>England</hi> thereby: you made ſuch Breaches in Families, that I fear are not made up to this day, unleſs Death hath reconciled them; this you did by the Advice of your Prieſts, Jeſuits, and Popiſh Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and the wicked Miniſtry at <hi>White-hall,</hi> who, rather than the People ſhould not be divided, took their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Copies by your Original, and came in a moſt comfortable manner to your Aſſiſtance, hoping to make the People rebel. Theſe Differences you nouriſhed with all the Induſtry imaginable, to the great Hazard of the whole Kingdom. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> this was to betray us into the Hands of our Popiſh Adverſaries, which they could not do but by inflaming the Differences between the Conforming and Non-conforming Proteſtants, that we might not unite our Forces againſt the Common Enemy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You and your Party by this means weakened the Proteſtant Intereſt. There can be nothing more plain than this: for upon the Diſſolution of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Swarms of Prieſts and Popiſh Conſpirators returned home, and fell to work, to pervert the People to the Obedience and Communion of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> What Penſions then you got for ſome, and Imployments for others; and with what care you maintain'd their Intereſt, and defended their Cauſe and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt thoſe that purſued them for their many Treaſons againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we all ſaw to our great Sorrow. And what help was there, ſince you and your Party had ſo much countenance from your Brother, who was ingaged with you in the whole Popiſh Conſpiracy, ſaving that of his own Life?</p>
               <p n="3">3. You procured a ſevere Perſecution againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters which you nor none of your raſcally Crew durſt do during the Seſſion of Parliament; but immediately upon their Diſſolution you fell upon them, either becauſe they had occaſioned the ſending of good Men to Parliament, or becauſe they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Aſſertors of the Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery, and of our Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties againſt Slavery: theſe were indeed high Crimes, for which you and your Villains made them ſmart, to the ruine of ſeveral thouſand Families; and had you continued ſomewhat longer in that glorious Adventure, you might have made poor <hi>England</hi> a howling Wilderneſs, tho when your Brother and you came home, you found it a Land flowing with Milk and Honey. Nay, you had rather all ſhould have run into Confuſion, than the Diſſenters ſhould not be ruined, becauſe they could not comply with a few Ceremonies, for which your Party had no other Authority than a few Acts of Parliaments.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100711:35"/>
               <p n="4">4. You advanced Arbitrary Proceedings in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> where you had a Set of rogniſh Judges exactly of a ſize for that turn, who had as much Impudence for the Court, as they had had Dread of being called to Account in Parliament for all their Villanies. And tho it was a ſtanding Conſtitution, that if any Man ſtood impeached by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> before the Lords in Parliament, no inferiour Court could take Cognizance of that Cauſe, or try him for that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> for which he ſtood impeached in Parliament, (which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Diſſolution of the Oxford-Parliament, was <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> his Caſe) yet for all this, you found out your <hi>Pemberton,</hi> your <hi>Jones,</hi> and your <hi>Raymond,</hi> that had Impudence enough to try the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and condemn him; for, alas, good Men, they were not to loſe their Places for every ſmall Peccadillo, if it were to ſerve the Government, eſpecially to do a Job for you and your Crew.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Upon the Diſſolution of the 3 laſt Parliaments, to alienate the King from his People, you and your Party did induſtriouſly revive the Memory of the late unhappy Civil War between your Father and the Parliament; which was your Brother's Intereſt as well as the Nation's to have buried in oblivion: the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning that unhappy War ſerv'd only to put us in mind of the ſudden Diſſolution of 3 Parliaments, and the 12 years want of one, and what the Villains had done in your Father's Reign: and the better to colour your procuring the Diſſolution of thoſe three Parliaments, you had your Parties abroad to aſperſe and brand the Members, as being of the ſame Complexion with thoſe that met <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1640; but none of your Cut-throats did ever mention the bloody Maſſacre in 1641, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe begun and carried on by your Father's Command, and for his Service.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me tell you, that none lived more peaceably under your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Government than they who were engaged in that War on the Parliament's ſide: therefore I cannot tell by what prudent Topick you went, when you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd thoſe Men in their obedient living by ſuch villanous Reflections, and upbraided them with what the Law had pardoned, and they had expiated by their Loyalty ſince, ſuppoſing they had been Criminals, which yet I think they were not. But this is plain beyond all diſpute, that the Parliament that reſtored your Brother to his Throne, and you to be a conſtant Plague to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made an Act of Indemnity, wherein many things were enacted, which they judged neceſſary for the Settlement of the Nation; they prohibited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Penalty, one Man's reproaching another with being concerned in that War, for the ſpace of three years after the Date of the ſaid Act: ſure then they never intended Men ſhould afterwards take the liberty to upbraid one another with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another ill Conſequence of diſſolving thoſe three Parliaments was, that by this means you made a way to ſucceed your Brother in the Government. If thoſe Parliaments had ſat, and their Counſels not been defeated by their unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Diſſolutions, you muſt have been diſabled from ever inheriting the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of theſe Realms: and it was plain, thoſe Whores and other Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that procured the Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments, aim'd at your coming to the Throne. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think your Party ſhould have ſhown ſo much Ingenuity and Candour, as to have owned that all the People of <hi>England,</hi> particularly thoſe that were for your Excluſion, were as zealous for Monarchy, even in the Royal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100711:36"/>
Line, as any of your clamorous Bullies durſt for their Ears be. I am ſure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much endanger'd the legal Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> as your coming to the Crown, which the Wiſdom of the Nation foreſaw; and therefore, that it might be preſerved, reſolved to paſs you by, and let it deſcend to another Heir. Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you had continued <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> I am ſure you might have lived with more Honour and Comfort than you can propoſe by putting your Feet under the French King's Table: but God having ordained you to be a Plague to us for our Sins, I think you let us ſee what you aimed at in your four Years Tyranny. There are ſome blind Puppies, whoſe Eyes are not yet opened; I could wiſh you had their Company at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> being confident you would ſoon lick them open.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Conſequence of the Diſſolution of thoſe three Parliaments, was the poſſeſſing the King of a Deſign carried on by the diſſenting Party for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to introduce a Democratical Power, which they called a <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> nay, that you might haſten the Diſſolution of the Oxford-Parliament, you made uſe of this Lie for an Argument, which your Brother was willing to believe, that he might have ſome Pretence for quitting that way of Government. There were two ſorts of Perſons charged: (1.) The Parliaments themſelves. (2.) Thoſe who ſtedfaſtly aſſerted the Power and Privileges of Parliaments, the Proteſtant Religion, and Liberties of the People, in oppoſition to Popery and Slavery.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Theſe Parliaments were charged with a Deſign againſt his Majeſty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> let us know what ground you had to raiſe ſuch a foul Report and Slander upon ſo conſiderable a part of the Legiſlative Power. I confeſs I can give no other name to theſe Proceedings of yours, than a Conſpiracy to deſtroy the uſe of Parliaments: therefore had your Brother cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another upon the Diſſolution of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, all Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants would have joined as one Man in humble Applications to that Aſſembly, that you and your infamous Crew might have a due Puniſhment for ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Reflections, and falſe Accuſations of thoſe Parliaments.</p>
               <p>It is well known, <hi>Sir,</hi> notwithſtanding your ſaid uſage of theſe Parliaments, that many of thoſe honourable Perſons, ſent up to ſerve as Members of thoſe Aſſemblies, had ventured their Lives, and loſt their Eſtates in endeavouring to reſtore the Monarchy, in oppoſition to that very thing you charged them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: Nay, they were all Lovers of Monarchy, not only upon true Engliſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but from their own Inclinations; for deceive not your ſelf, they had too ſad experience of a Common-wealth, to be in love with that way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they well knew was inconſiſtent with the Genius of this Nation, and that nothing more agreed with the Peoples Temper than a well-regulated Monarchy, as ours is by the fundamental Laws of the Realm; and if your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had but conſidered the Point, he could not have believ'd otherwiſe, than that they were not, nor could be true to the Monarchy, that joined with you and your Conſpirators to ſubvert the Rights and Privileges of Parliaments.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Parliaments not only lay under this filthy Calumny, but your Party did alſo traduce thoſe brave Men that ſtedfaſtly aſſerted the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Parliament, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of the People,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100711:36"/>
as being in a Conſpiracy againſt the King and Government: but 'tis plain that you knew not one Soul engaged in any ſuch Conſpiracy; if you did, why did you not (according to your Duty and Allegiance) diſcover them, that they might have been brought to Juſtice? If not, why was all that noiſe made of a Conſpiracy againſt the King's Perſon and Government? But I believe you were afraid that your Folly as well as Knavery would have been manifeſted to the World, and your Malice too into the Bargain. Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me tell you, that upon the Intimation given by your Devil's Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, and the ſpecial Direction of old <hi>Hodg</hi> the Fidler to your little Paraſitical Clerks, the Pulpits rung with the noiſe of a Presbyterian Plot, in order to betray us into Popery and Arbitrary Power: for many, if not all, but eſpecially thoſe who made ſome ſort of Figure in the Country, hung their Tongues, and ſet the tune of their Preaching to the humour of the Times, and like the Devil's Meſſengers, being inſtigated by your High Prieſts, all they preached was againſt the Diſſenters, charging them with a Deſign to bring in a Common-wealth and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>But why was all this noiſe about a Prebyterian Plot? Come, I'll tell you the Reaſon: You may remember that your Popiſh Party were by me and others charg'd with a Helliſh Conſpiracy againſt the Perſon of the King, our Religion and Government, and the Lives of all the Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> and this prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them to the ſatisfaction of all ſober Men, as well by their own Papers as the Teſtimonies of ſeveral Witneſſes; and finding all your deviliſh Arts and Practices could not bring your ſelves off from the Reproach you juſtly lay under, or the Puniſhment you muſt have ſuffered, had a Parliament been permitted to ſit, you made this noiſe of a Diſſenters Plot as your laſt Refuge, which you and your Crew ſaid was againſt the Monarchy under pretence of proſecuting a Popiſh Conſpiracy: And therefore with what Application did you form the Intrigue of the Meal-tub, and alſo thoſe Shams of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey</hi>'s murdering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s penning <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Libel? all which diſcovered your Purpoſes, as well as your Diſappointments at once.</p>
               <p>Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Party never conſidered what a notorious Scandal they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to faſten not only upon the moſt conſiderable People of <hi>England,</hi> but the whole Kingdom, which you cauſed to ſuffer much in its Reputation abroad, as broken and divided againſt it ſelf, and relapſing into Confuſion and Anarchy. Nay, let me tell you, that you and your Party hereby brought your Brother, and his Government and Prudence under the greateſt Diſreputation: for muſt not our Neighbours ſtand amazed to ſee a King (reſtored by unanimous Conſent, to the great Joy of the Nation) in ſo few Years loſe that Eſteem, Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for ſo great a number of his Subjects as you had cauſed to be accuſed? What Nation would maintain an Alliance with ſuch a King, who had ſo much ſunk his Intereſt? How could they expect he ſhould be able to ſupport and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends of ſuch an Alliance? Your great Ally the French King could not but laugh in his Sleeve, to ſee the Nation in ſuch a Poſture. Nay further, what Jealouſies did you create in the Peoples Minds, ſo that the Popiſh Party were ſtrengthned to deſtroy both Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts, who were both Hereticks to them? Hereby alſo that Impudent Tyrant the French King was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to proceed in his Ravages upon his Neighbours Countries; and if your
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100711:37"/>
Brother ſhould have had the leaſt Inclination to put a ſtop to this <hi>Nimrod,</hi> what a Condition would he have been in, ſince you and your French Penſioners had created ſuch Feuds amongſt us?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another Evil happening upon the Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments, was your Endeavours to perſwade the People that they were in a ſecure State, with relation to their Religion, Laws and Liberties, that ſo the Nation might be a Prey to your Popiſh Crew. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> how can your Party anſwer the ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we were in the midſt of ſo many notorious Dangers? Do you not remember that four Parliaments had repreſented the manifold Dangers the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was threatned with? And hath it not been one of the greateſt Difficulties that ever a Nation groaned under, to preſerve it ſelf from your Popiſh Rage and Fury? Nay, all thinking Men judged it impoſſible: but God, with whom all things are poſſible, did the Work his own way, you know well enough, to your woful experience. I remember your Conſpirators uſed to wipe their Mouths, and mimp them up with a maidenly <hi>God damme, the Nation was in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the Popiſh Party,</hi> tho the King in ſeveral Proclamations had ſignified the ſame: and if your Raſcals had not the manners to believe the Parliament, they might have believed the King, ſince he not only publiſhed his Proclamations to let the Nation know its danger, but alſo in divers Speeches to both Houſes of Parliament acquainted them therewith; and upon the whole not only required their Advice and Counſel, but propoſed that ſome effectual Laws might be made to prevent thoſe Dangers and Miſchiefs that then attended the Nation.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> you and your Party may ſay, <hi>What danger could there be, ſince the Laws of the Land were the Rule of his Government?</hi> To which I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Suppoſe K. <hi>Charles</hi> had all his days governed according to the Laws of the Land; was his having governed according to the Laws already, ſufficient to diſcourage you and your Villains from plotting to deſtroy us? And when your Conſpiracy was detected, did the King's governing according to Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Fears we had of the Popiſh Party?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>We had an ill Opinion of your Brother and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thence came our pretended Fears and Jealouſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> you are miſtaken, our Fears did not proceed ſo much from our ill Opinion of him, as from the ſenſe we had of the implacable Hatred you and your villanous Popiſh Party had to him, and your Reſolution to deſtroy him, becauſe he made not ſuch ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> to deſtroy us as you would have had him. But ſuppoſe we had entertain'd all evil Opinion of the King, we had juſt Cauſe for it, he having left us in the hands of ſuch as were ſo far from protecting the Nation, that not one Law made to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion was put in execution: and you had ſo filled the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> with a Set of Rogues, that perverted the Law to the hazard of the whole Nation, that your Traitors eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thoſe Puniſhments due to them for their many Treaſons.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Could the Laws we then had (without ſome additional Proviſion) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our ſafety, ſince you were to ſucceed him? Were not you and your Party then the worſt of Men to declare to the World, that we were in no danger, notwithſtanding your vigorous Application to extirpate the Northern Hereſy, which you were in a more effectual way to effect than ever? Hence may appear
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100711:37"/>
the Malice of your Party in preaching Peace, when they were preparing to make War upon us.</p>
               <p>I might enumerate other Evils that happened on Diſſolving thoſe Parliaments, but theſe at preſent ſhall ſerve, and therefore I come to the laſt Particular of the third Head of this Article, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly;</hi> The fooliſh Pretences you and your Party made for procuring theſe 3 Parliaments to be diſſolved in ſo reproachful a manner; all which prove you an Enemy to Parliaments, and that way of Governing. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me put you in mind that your Brother hated Parliaments mortally, which appears by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the French King in <hi>June</hi> 1676. to this purpoſe, That <hi>if he could be aſſured of his Penſion, that it might continue, he ſhould not continue that way of Governing,</hi> (viz. by frequent Parliaments) <hi>which at the beſt was but a clamorous Rabble, that took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to direct Kings: but as he was reſolved to be like his Neighbours in Riches and Grandeur, ſo he was reſolved to be like them in Religion too.</hi> Thus it ſeems at the long-run you were both of a mind, except that he was not ſo hardy in obſerving his own word, to ruin the Nation all at once, as you were: and what your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pretences were for Diſſolving three Parliaments to effect the ſame, you have laid before you in theſe following Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The firſt Pretence was their too vigorous proſecuting the Popiſh Plot. Now with what colour could you charge this upon them? for as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo I muſt again, that thoſe Parliaments were compoſed of Men of as good Senſe and Quality as any in the whole Kingdom, who proceeded and managed their debates with as great Moderation and Gravity as became their Place; if they went too far in any thing relating to that curſed Deſign, you might have inſtanced in the Particular, and not have ſuffered your Hell-born Crew to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their whole Proceeding in it. But let me tell you, they were ſo far from going too far, that your Brother and you ſuffer'd 'em not to ſit till they could do any thing conſiderable in any part of the Diſcovery. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me ask you one Queſtion; Why did not you and your Party rather fall upon the King and his Miniſters for thoſe Speeches and Declarations he made concerning the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, of which you ſhall have your full in its proper place? But pray obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Your Brother did frequently recommend the Proſecution of the Popiſh Plot to them with a ſtrict and impartial Inquiry: and can you think that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, conſiſting of ſo many worthy Patriots, would be ſuch Traitors to their King and Country, as not to comply in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome meaſure with his Commands, eſpecially ſince in his Speech, <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1680. he uſed that prevailing Argument, <hi>That he neither thought himſelf nor them ſafe, till the Matter was gone through with.</hi> Was not the King's Perſon nor Government ſafe; and would you not have them zealous in inquiry into the ſaid Plot, to prevent the threatning Dangers?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Did not your Brother in his Speech to his Parliament, <hi>April</hi> 30. 1679. aſſure them of <hi>his conſtant Care to ſecure our Religion for the future in all Events, and that in all things which concerned the publick Security, he would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> follow their Zeal, but lead it?</hi> Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may ſee that by making this a Pretence for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving three Parliaments, you did fly in the very Face of the King and his lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal to have that Plot diſcovered, and the Criminals brought to publick Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100711:38"/>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> A ſecond Pretence you and your <hi>Banditti</hi> had for diſſolving the three laſt Parliaments was, becauſe they would give no Money for ſupporting the Alliance your Brother had made for preſerving Chriſtendom in Peace, and the keeping of <hi>Tangier:</hi> by which the Nation might ſee the true Reaſon for which thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were called. The truth is, <hi>Sir,</hi> you had almoſt perſwaded the King not to uſe that Parliament which ſat down <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1680. and in order to that you made Application to the French King for a Sum of 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and promiſed if your Brother was ſupplied with it, the Parliament ſhould not meet. The French King agreed, and the Money was to be paid at two Paiments. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the Parliament newly choſen in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679, was prorogued till <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following; and your great Ally aſſuring your Brother of the Paiment of the Money, the Parliament was further prorogued till <hi>October</hi> 21. 1680. ſo that we had no Parliament ſitting from <hi>May</hi> 1679, till <hi>October</hi> 1680. but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> getting Intelligence of this Contrivance, and being in danger of his Life by the Subornation of a Villain, to whom he had given Bread, as alſo to his whole raſcally Family, finding his Head muſt fly for it if a Parliament did not meet, makes a Journey over to <hi>France,</hi> and ſo prevailed with the French King, that the Money promiſed was not tranſmitted; ſo that of Neceſſity (not of Choice) you permitted your good Brother that one time to meet his People in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Well then, Supplies were demanded to maintain the Alliance made for the Support of the General Peace of Chriſtendom, the Preſervation of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and for the Paiment of your Brother's Debts; and the Parliament would give no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> a word or two to the point in general, and then I will deſcend to ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What, would not the Parliament give Money to ſupport the Alliances? I'll aſſure you they were a parcel of naughty Boys indeed to be ſo refractory. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> with whom were thoſe Alliances made? with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Alas, pious chaſte Lady, ſhe had been a Caſt-whore for ſeveral Years; the triple League between your Brother, her Grace, and Mother <hi>Knight,</hi> had been broke for many Years, and ſhe had made a new Alliance with her good Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and had given him all ſhe had for a Guaranty. What Alliances then were they? Were they new ones with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and <hi>Nell Waal?</hi> Truly your Band of Penſioners had ſo often ſupplied their extraordinary Occaſions, that one would think they ſhould not have asked any more; and if they knew not when they had enough, the Nation could tell them they had too much, and wanted nothing but an Apartment at a convenient Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe in <hi>Tuttle-fields,</hi> and the civil Uſage of that Houſe once a Week or ſo, as the Ladies of their Profeſſion uſe to be ſerv'd, as a juſt Reward of their Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their Calling. It may be, <hi>Sir,</hi> there were Alliances of another nature (as with <hi>Barillon</hi> your old Friend) that were to be ſupported: Alas the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment knew full well that your Brother and you could not want a Supply for ſuch Alliances; and that rather than fail, you might have got a new Bill to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Intituled, <hi>An Act to enter into an actual War with</hi> France, with which you might ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e beg'd Money of the French King, as you did in 1678.</p>
               <p>It may be you will ſay, They were Alliances your Brother had made for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100711:38"/>
of the General Peace of Chriſtendom. You ſay well; and it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſince your Brother was graciouſly pleaſed to demand Money, that he was not as graciouſly pleaſed to tell the Parliament what thoſe Alliances were. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Sir,</hi> you did not expect a blind Obedience from that Eagle-ey'd Parliament, to contribute to the Support of what they were wholly ignorant of; or if they had had ſome Hints from the Court, it would not have been amiſs to have uſed them as civilly as your Band of Penſioners were, and to have had thoſe Alliances laid before them: thoſe humble Curs never parted with Money for the ſupport of Leagues, till acquainted with the Nature and Tendency of them. And if the Alliances were not deſigned for the end pretended, you might have asked Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with as good Succeſs for the two Whores at the lower end of the matted Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, both Miſtreſs and Woman, as for thoſe Alliances.</p>
               <p>Let me, good <hi>Sir,</hi> ask you one fair Queſtion; Did your Brother expect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for theſe Alliances, and nothing elſe? and for once we will ſuppoſe <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and her Woman not to have had one Great, no nor <hi>Fitz-Harrris</hi> ſo much as a Sop in the Pan, tho he had a hopeful Plot upon the Stocks that deſerved two, but that it ſhould be applied only for Alliances made to preſerve the General Peace of Chriſtendom: truly then, ought not the Parliament to conſider well of the General Peace it ſelf, and its Influence upon our Affairs, before they came to any Reſolution, or ſo much as to debate about it, ſince you had a Tool in the Miniſtry that told us, it was more fit for Meditation than Diſcourſe; nay, he impudently ſaid the Peace was but the effect of Deſpair, and I think he was not much out in it; but he might have been ſo honeſt as to have told us the true Cauſe of that Deſpair: yet for all his Worſhip's Rhetorick, the Nation learn'd by whoſe means they were reduced to ſo low a Thought of their Condition; nay, if that Loggerhead were alive, I could tell him what Price you and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demanded of the Fr. King for that noble and moſt Chriſtian piece of Service.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>Sir,</hi> we had no reaſon to ſimper upon the Buſineſs, unleſs with the wrong ſide of our Mouths; for we could not ſing any Tune but that lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one of a bad Market: we all knew the effect of this General Peace of Chiſtendom, that it was the Diſſolving the Confederacy againſt the French King, the Enlarging his Dominions, and his gaining time to refreſh his Souldiers almoſt haraſſed out of their Lives by long Service, the ſettling and compoſing the Minds of his Vaſſals at home, increaſing his Fleet, and filling his Exchequer for new and greater Deſigns: but your Rogues, that were Penſioners to the French King, grew impudent upon it, and expected he might have a ſpare hour or ſo to aſſiſt you in ruining the Religion, Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and to have fairly laid aſide the uſe of Parliaments, and broke them up, as you would have done a Field-meeting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or a private Conventicle in <hi>England,</hi> and treated them like Traitors and Villains, and not like the great Aſſembly and Wiſdom of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Was it the Alliance your Brother had made with the States General? Truly your Band of Penſioners had ſo ſtigmatized that, that neither the firſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> nor the Oxford-Parliament would foul their Fingers with it, much leſs give any Money towards the Support of it; for the Penſioners, ſpeaking modeſtly, could not believe it tended to the ſafety of the Nation. Truly I muſt look again,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100711:39"/>
and ſee what this new Alliance was; and, good <hi>Sir,</hi> I beg your pardon, it was a new Alliance with <hi>Spain:</hi> and would they not give Money to ſupport this? Well, let us then ſee how the Caſe ſtood in relation to it.</p>
               <p>I confeſs Alliances to a Parliament make a very pretty noiſe, and may be as diverting as ever old <hi>Hodg</hi>'s Fiddle was to any of his Tory Gang. Indeed old <hi>England</hi> ſtood in need of ſome new Friends, being ſo beſet with Enemies abroad, and with Penſioners to thoſe Enemies at home: but what ſhall I ſay to this Point? When I view the Speech at the opening of that Parliament that ſat down <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1680. there is nothing ſaid of any new Ally, except the poor Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, whoſe Affairs at that time, thro' the Defects of his own Government, and the villanous falſeneſs of our Miniſters, were reduced to ſuch Extremities, that he might ſooner have been a Burden to the Nation than a Help; unleſs you let us judg that this Name of a new League was neceſſary to recommend our Miniſters to a new Parliament, and bubble our honeſt Country Gentlemen out of their Money: for by it we were like to have trouble enough, being to eſpouſe, without any Limitation, all the Quarrels of the Spaniards, tho in the <hi>Philippina</hi> Iſlands and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or that he had drawn upon himſelf by any of his Barbarities there or elſewhere; nay, his difference with the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> was not excepted, tho all that Elector had done in Repriſals upon the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ships for a juſt Debt often demanded in vain, was according to the Law of Nations, and the Rules of Juſtice: nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> we might have been engaged in his Quarrel with old <hi>Kate</hi>'s native Country, which we ought to have had ſpecial regard of for the Bleſſing they ſent us in 1662. And pray what was the Quarrel? Truly nothing but a treacherous ſeizing the Iſland of <hi>St. Gabriel,</hi> which the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe had peaceably enjoyed ſeveral Years; upon which you know Jack the Portugueſe invaded ſome part of the Spaniſh Country. Alſo by virtue of this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we were even obliged to aſſiſt the Spaniard, in caſe of any diſturbance in his own Dominions. You and your Brother were admirable good at ſecret Articles, and in one of thoſe it is plainly expreſſed we were to furniſh him 8000 Men for 3 Months; ſo that if he inclin'd to make his Subjects as great Slaves to the Crown as they are to the Church, our good King was to aſſiſt him in ſo good a Work.</p>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> when I reflect on <hi>Philip</hi> the Second's Barbarity to the People of the Low Countries, whom our Anceſtors thought fit to ſuccour, I could not but think this Alliance now under debate was for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Good of the Nation, becauſe my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> and old <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi> told me ſo; and therefore (as the Stars would have it) it was not fit the League ſhould be laid before the Parliament, leſt they ſhould think ſo too, and find a blind ſide or two in it; and think it would contribute but little to the Good of the Nation, or ſecuring the Peace of poor <hi>Flanders.</hi> Well, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Cake proved Dough that bout, for there was Death in the Pot, a ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my aimed at in <hi>England,</hi> that would not down with us at that time, of which you were to have been General, that would have done more good Buſineſs upon <hi>Hounſlow-Heath</hi> than in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for they were not to help the Spaniard till the French had invaded them three Months, and it's well known he could then have been Maſter of a conſiderable part of that Country. But yet no Money came, nor can I help it if I ſhould cry my Eyes out; let me therefore be a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100711:39"/>
with you, and ask two or three Queſtions; it may be we may find ſome Expedient they might have uſed to allay the matter on your ſide. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this League the beſt that ever could be made, yet,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Had not the Parliament juſt Cauſe to be very jealous of your Brother's Sincerity in this Alliance, and the more becauſe he would not declare what it was, nor ſuffer it to be laid before them? Therefore had it been the beſt in Chriſtendom, nay as good as that between him, and <hi>Cleveland,</hi> and Mother <hi>Knight</hi> the Bawd, which he had broken for ſeveral years, or that that was then in being between Mrs. <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and her Woman <hi>Nell Waall;</hi> yet what could they ſay to ſuch a League, or what Security could they have that it ſhould be kept more than the Triple League, or that with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or that with the States General, which were all broken almoſt as ſoon as made?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> had been ill uſed by you and your <hi>Banditti,</hi> and therefore you muſt allow this not to meet with that Temper you deſir'd; who after they had heard of this Alliance, were not ſuffered ſo much as to have it laid before them to conſider of, tho it had been before your Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and <hi>Barillon</hi> the French Ambaſſadour had peruſed it, and was privy to the ſecret Article in it, and had (not like a Man of Truth) given a Copy of it to one that let ſome have a ſight of it. Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> you and your Party could not but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a Parliament by theſe Carriages; and how then could you expect Money to ſupport this new Alliance?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> how was it poſſible any good could come to Chriſtendom in general, or to theſe Nations in particular, by this new Alliance? It is plain that all Chriſtendom after the ſeparate Peace with the Dutch, could not preſerve <hi>Spain</hi> and the Spaniſh Netherlands from falling under the Dominion of the French King; how then could your Brother by this new Alliance be in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupport them, without the Dutch, ſince by the help of you and your Traitors he brought this Nation into a diſtracted and deplorable Condition? Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> one word more; What good could theſe Kingdoms expect by this Alliance, ſince thereby all the Hardſhips imaginable were put upon our Traders both to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies?</hi> and had that King been as able as willing, he would have let you known it 'ere this time.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Was it not unreaſonable to ask Money for the ſupport of this League, tho we ſuppoſe it the beſt that ever was made? Your Brother was the firſt King that ever asked Money to ſupport Alliances. I have read of Kings, when by the Advice of Parliament they have made War upon any of their Neighbours, they have called for Money to carry it on with Vigour; but I never find any of our Kings that ever called for Money to ſupport Alliances, eſpecially when they were juſtly aſhamed to declare what they were.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Again; Your Crew, I confeſs, at that time made a horrid noiſe about the Spaniſh Alliance, and wondered the Parliament would give no Money to maintain it: Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> there was never yet an Alliance made with any State in Chriſtendom, (if a good one) but would earn its own living, and therefore needed no Money to ſupport it; if it were a bad one, I am ſure it deſerved none.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Once more, and I'll conclude this Point: ſince your Party made ſuch a noiſe about the Spaniſh Alliance, pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> how was it kept? If my Memory
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100711:40"/>
fails not, it was not over-well obſerved: for I think in 1682. your Ally the French King blocked up <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> and in the year my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, took <hi>Courtray,</hi> one of the ſix Towns delivered up by the French to the Spaniard, and keeps it to this Day, as he doth <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> which he took by force in 1684. Now I do not find your Brother ever aſſiſted this Confederate of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the Alliance, or as he was Guarantee in the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> which in his excellent Declaration of War againſt the Dutch he declared he would maintain. Upon the whole, I ſee no reaſon why the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould have given any Money to ſupport this Alliance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Parliament would give no Money for the ſupport of this Alliance, ſo neither for the ſupport of <hi>Tangier:</hi> this ſtuck mightily in your Stomach, and in the Maws of all your Party. Now, <hi>Sir, Tangier</hi> being moſt valiantly deſerted, it deſerves not to be mentioned; but becauſe it ſo highly offended your Friends, who to this day mention it with reluctancy, I will ſay a word or two to it. It is ſome years ſince that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> (to the beſt of my remembrance 'twas in 1680) gave it a due Conſideration; nay, they were ſo candid as to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the King how that important Place came to be in ſo miſerable a Condition, after ſo vaſt a Treaſure conſumed to make it uſeful; and that nothing better could be expected of it, ſince it conſiſted moſt of Papiſts, and ſuch as were Enemies to the Religion, Laws and Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe Inconveniencies might have been redreſſed by your Brother, had he ſo pleaſed; and truly the Parliament adviſed him to it: nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may put on your Spectacles, and read the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of Parliament <hi>November</hi> 1680, wherein they promiſed to aſſiſt him in the Defence of that Place, if they might have a tolerable Security that any Supply for it ſhould not be applied to augment the Strength of our Popiſh Adverſaries, and to increaſe our Dangers at home from that villanous Faction: and could you with any reaſon blame them, ſince they had to their Sorrow ſeen Money imployed contrary to thoſe Ends, for which given by your Band of Penſioners? But above all, the Popiſh Party's Inſolencies, and the Impudence of thoſe that eſpouſed the French Intereſt, threatned the Nation with total Ruine at home; and therefore they judged it not prudence to leave the Conſideration of <hi>England,</hi> to provide for <hi>Tangier,</hi> it looking like ſecuring one ſingle Cabin, whilſt the whole Ship was on fire. Therefore to conclude this Head, let me ask you theſe plain Queſtions:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Whether it could be judged conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of a Parliament, that had ſeen the diſmal Conſequences of the Incouragement your Popiſh Party had received from your Brother and you, to give Money to ſupply a Gariſon, which was uſed to augment their Strength, and increaſe the danger of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and whether you would not have laughed as much at them for ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, as you did at your Band of Penſioners for giving 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> for the King's extraordinary Occaſions in 1673, or for that vaſt Sum they gave for a War with <hi>France</hi> in 1678?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Had you not ſeveral Regiments in pay, beſides the Guards, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which might be tranſported and maintained as cheap there as here? and would it not have been more honourable for them to have been ſent to <hi>Tangier,</hi> to have beaten the Moors, than to ſtay at home to beat their Landlords and Landladies in their Quarters?</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100711:40"/>
               <p n="3">(3.) Had you not a Company of Popiſh Gentlemens Sons to be imployed in that Service, whoſe Fathers were undone by the Supply they gave for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liberty of Conſcience, and the Dutch War, in order to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion all over <hi>Europe?</hi> And could you and your Teagues think, on any rational ground, that ever a Proteſtant Parliament would give Money to preſerve that Place, which was nothing elſe but a Nurſery of Popiſh Officers and Souldiers? I believe your Popiſh young Gentlemen might want the Charity of thoſe Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the Parliament had a foreſight of the fatal Conſequences that would attend the placing their Bounty upon ſuch Vermin, who would have been ready to return home for thoſe ends deſigned by you and your Council at St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Parliament would not part with Money for Paiment of the Debt of the Exchequer to the Bankers, which your Crew urg'd did put your Brother out of a Poſſibility of ſupporting the Government: This is the Charge, and a heavy one too. Now what was this Government that was to be ſupported, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of naſty Whores, Pimps, Bawds, Informers, Suborners of Perjury, Murderers, and Thieves? This was your Government in your Brother's days, was it not? Nay, did he not conſume more Money upon ſuch Vermine in one year, than would ſerve the Government of <hi>England</hi> ten? Did the Credit of the Crown both at home and abroad depend upon <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s having 52000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling a Year, and <hi>Nel Waal,</hi> for being Bawd in ordinary, getting 30 or 40000 <hi>l.</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and other Cattle of the ſame Profeſſion being maintained in all manner of Luxury, for no other merit but having had a hand in the ruin of the Nation? No, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Credit of the Government did not depend thereupon; the Parliaments did not ſettle Revenues, nor give Taxes for ſuch Ends: but your Brother and you had advanced the Credit of the Government, if you had ſent ſuch Vermin to <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> to have been ſet to work for their living, as Whores ought to be, and to have the Correction of the Houſe, all Titles of Honour to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> to be plain with you, the Honours of <hi>England</hi> are intruſted with the King, but were never deſigned for ſuch Vermin as <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> that was but the Daughter of a poor French Fellow, or a Baſtard of ſome Body, I name not who, nor to have whole Families advanced for providing or pimping another Man's Wife to be a Whore Royal, that has had no leſs (to ſpeak modeſtly) than 20 Stallions to attend her, beſides your dear Brother of bleſſed Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> it is certain, notwithſtanding the noiſe your Party made of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's being (thro' the Parliaments refuſing to give Money) put out of a Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to pay his Debts, that he never would pay them, which was his Reſolution: and therefore what Faith could be given to his Promiſes, tho he knew the Honour of the Nation would ſuffer highly in his taking up his Brother of <hi>France</hi>'s Cuſtom of not being a Slave to his Word? The truth is, had the People always been to pay his Debts, there might have been Taxes without end: this, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Band of Penſioners well knew, who therefore, as mercenary as they were, would never pay the Debt due to the Bankers: and the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament, having ſo fair and freſh an Inſtance before their Eyes, and their Ears filled with the daily Cries of the Widows and Orphans, were obliged in duty to give a publick Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People not to run again into the ſame Error, becauſe they judged all Securities of that Nature abſolutely void, and that no future Parliament could
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100711:41"/>
without breach of Truſt repay that Money that was at firſt borrowed to prevent the ſitting of a Parliament. Thus I have gone through all the Particulars of the ſecond Pretence, that is, that the Parliament would not ſupply your Brother with Money to ſupport the Spaniſh Alliance, preſerve <hi>Tangier,</hi> and to pay his Debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> You had another Pretence for procuring thoſe three Parliaments to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> two Votes that paſſed the Commons <hi>Jan.</hi> 7. 1680. 1. That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould lend, or cauſe to be lent by way of Advance, any Money upon the Branches of the King's Revenue ariſing by way of Cuſtoms, Exciſe and Hearth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, ſhall be adjudged the hinderer of the ſitting of Parliaments, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for the ſame. 2. That whoſoever ſhould accept or buy any Tally, or Anticipation upon any part of the King's Revenue, or ſhall pay ſuch Tally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be ſtruck, ſhall be adjudged to hinder the ſitting of Parliaments, and be reſponſible therefore in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Votes, you had a Rogue that roſe from a Kitchin-boy to poſſeſs (as ſome ſay) 14000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> of which he wronged the Nation, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had the Opportunity to cheat three Governments, and ſuck their Blood, to whom the City of <hi>London</hi> ows much of her Miſery; he, I ſay, furniſhed your Brother with Money in contempt of theſe Votes: but he has wiped his Mouth, and hugs himſelf, as if not one of the greateſt Villains that ever <hi>England</hi> bore: I leave him, he was a Friend of yours, and you have reaſon to remember him. I remember the Votes very well, and certainly they were juſtifiable to the whole Kingdom: for conſider a little, did you take the Revenue to be diſpoſed of at your Brother's pleaſure? Was it for his private uſe, or the publick Good? <hi>Sir,</hi> the Revenue the Parliament had fixed was a publick, not a private one: your Brother was truſted with the diſpoſing of part only, and that not without the Advice of ſome of his great Miniſters of State, as a Secretary of State, and the Lord Privy Seal, for ſmaller Sums; and for all great Paiments, the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Lord Keeper, or Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, were to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: the other part of the Revenue was aſſigned to other Uſes; the Cuſtoms to the maintenance of the Navy. The Maintenance of the Houſehold, the Tables at Court, and Wages of the King's Servants, were in our former Kings Reigns ſo eſtabliſhed by Parliament, that the Cofferer had his Money paid him out of the Exchequer, under great Penalties to be inflicted for the neglect thereof; and the Houſe of Lords judged it a great part of their immediate Care: It maintained the Dignity and Honour of the Government, and contributed much to Love and good Underſtanding between the King and People; no Countrey Farmer had Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at Court, but he found thoſe who bad him welcome, and ſo had all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; therefore the King's Servants had juſtly the ſame Return wherever they came: the outward Rooms of the Houſe did not ſmell of Match, nor was the Language of the Court, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> there uſed to be the Smell of better Hoſpitality: this was plain even in your Father's time.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'tis well known, that by the evil Counſel and Courſe your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and you took, you made the Bankers of <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere become the very Bane of the Nation; not only to the Gentleman and Farmer, but I doubt to the Merchant too, they raiſed and kept up the Intereſt of Money; they drained the Country, and bought Warrants, ſo that your Brother paid 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100711:41"/>
for all his Expences. You know the Revenue was in many of its Branches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, and proviſion made that they ſhould not be alienated: and if raſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fellows that had decoyed into their Cuſtody the ready Monies of Merchants, Gentlemen and others, did by the Strength of their Caſh anticipate the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Government, who could have provided for the Nation? Could any but a Parliament do it? Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> it plainly follows, that if your Brother had found out another way to ſupply his Wants than by Parliament, the great hinge on which the Government turn'd was loſt: therefore what ground you and your Party had to make this a Pretence to put off thoſe Parliaments, eſpecially the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter-Parliament,</hi> I cannot tell; and how you could make them Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals for theſe two Votes, I leave to the Judgment even of your ragged Miniſtry at St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4ly.</hi> A <hi>4th</hi> Pretence you had for diſſolving the Parliaments aforeſaid, was a Vote concerning Proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>That the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the Subject, a weakning the Proteſtant Intereſt, an Incouragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi> This was the Vote of the Commons in the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter-Parliament:</hi> Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> they could not but paſs the Vote as their Opinion, ſince they judged themſelves invited to it by your Brother himſelf, who had often wiſhed, whilſt his Band of Penſioners ſat, that he might be able to exerciſe a Power of Diſpenſation in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Proteſtants, who thro' the tenderneſs of a miſguided Conſcience did not conform to the Ceremonies, Diſcipline and Government of the Church; and promiſed he would make it his ſpecial Care to incline the Wiſdom of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to concur with him in making an Act to that purpoſe. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I know your Party uſually ſaid, that theſe Inclinations of the King laſted no longer than he had a Proſpect of giving the Papiſts an equal Benefit of Toleration alſo: I doubt it was too true, and that they had that honourable Notion of the King from your ſweet ſelf; but whether true or no, I will not inſiſt here, but ſhall only mind you, that your Brother after he parted with you, did on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in his Speech to the firſt <hi>Weſtminſter-Parliament</hi> (after the disbanding your ſmall Officers) expreſs his Zeal not only for the Proteſtant Religion in general, but for a Union amongſt all ſorts of Proteſtants: and did he not command the then Tool of a Chancellor at the very ſame time to tell them, that it was neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between Proteſtant and other Recuſants, between them that would deſtroy the whole Flock, and thoſe that wander from it? I am much diſpos'd to believe, and that on good ground, that your Brother was not ſincere in the thing; yet whatever his Heart was in the Caſe, the following Parliament might juſtly incourage that Vote from the aforeſaid Declarations.</p>
               <p>You and your wicked Party, eſpecially your Church-Bums, did attacque that laſt <hi>Weſtminſter-Parliament,</hi> as if that Vote relating to Proteſtant Diſſenters, was to ſhew that the Commons had in themſelves a Power of ſuſpending the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws eſtabliſhed by the three States of the Realm, who yet ſaid it was a Power not to be allow'd in the King, and cauſed to be cancelled all that he had done in relation to the eaſe of Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and if the King had not Power to ſuſpend the execution of the Penal Laws, then had not they. To this I anſwer:</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100711:42"/>
               <p n="1">1. A few Years before that Parliament ſat, your wicked Miniſters did remember that the whole Nation was juſtly alarm'd upon the King's aſſuming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by their Advice an arbitrary Power of ſuſpending the Penal Laws; upon this they thought it very popular to charge the Houſe of Commons with an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation on that Attempt. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> if they did by a Vote declare the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of proſecuting Proteſtant Diſſenters at that time, or at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I cannot ſee where the Crime was, or of what Uſurpation they ſtood guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince they made the Vote for the very ſame Reaſon which your Brother had for expreſſing himſelf as he did in his foreſaid Speech, ſuppoſing his Heart had kept pace with his Tongue: they had with great Trouble of Soul perceived that the Deſign of the Popiſh Party was not againſt any one Sort of Proteſtants, but againſt all; they were ſenſible what Advantages your Popiſh Crew had made of our Diviſions, and obſerved with what Subtlety they had eſcaped Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution by the Laws in force againſt them, by fomenting our Jealouſies: they ſaw the Strength and Greatneſs of the French King, and how his Intereſt had been advanced by your Brother and you, and judged of his Inclinations by his bloody Uſage of his own Proteſtant Subjects: they conſidered the Number of the Iriſh Papiſts, and their bloody Principles and Practices, and what Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were formed in that Kingdom, and were ripe for Execution; and that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was in the Hands of you and your Villains; and that you was the Head of the Popiſh and Popiſhly affected Party in the three Kingdoms: they had with Grief obſerved that all the Places of Truſt both Civil and Military were in the Hands of the avowed Enemies of the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the humble Addreſſes made to the King, and all his Proclamations for a ſtrict Execution of the Penal Laws againſt Papiſts, yet your villanous Faction evaded thoſe Laws, and went ſcotfree, and only the poor Proteſtant Diſſenters ſmarted under their Severity.</p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, certainly that Houſe of Commons had as much Reaſon to think of an Union amongſt Proteſtants in 1680, as your Brother had (if ever he ſpake Truth) in 1679. And can you think they had any juſt Ground to believe that the Proteſtant Diſſenters, whilſt under ſuch Preſſures and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſhould chearfully and couragiouſly undertake the Defence of their Countrey, ſince by it they had been, and then were ſo ill treated? Experience taught them it was in vain to force us to be of one Opinion, and therefore the Commons took a very probable way to unite us in Affection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, they made this Vote, not to arrogate to themſelves a ſuſpending Power, but to ſhew they had a repealing Power: They well knew that your buſy Raſcals would be ſtriking whilſt there were Weapons at hand; and therefore (that the Land might be in Peace) they deſigned to take away all Occaſions of Provocation from each other, and reſolved to take away thoſe Penal Laws that occaſioned them, and accordingly began with a Vote, declaring the Neceſſity of it; to which (if I am not much miſtaken) there was not one Negative in the Houſe: and a Vote of this nature did but precede the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Bill for the Repeal of that, or thoſe Laws they had voted grievous and inconvenient. With what Face could you or your Party revile a Parliament for ſo regular a Proceeding, according to the Cuſtom and Uſage of Parliaments?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100711:42"/>
How could you call the voting of a Law or Laws grievous and inconvenient, a ſuſpending of Acts of Parliament, and charge them with Contempt of the Law eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We will ſuppoſe the Commons did not intend to bring in a Bill to repeal the Laws then in force againſt Diſſenters; for the Vote was not made to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a Power of ſuſpending Acts of Parliament; neither did they require the Judges to forbear the Execution of them, who were bound to ſee them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but they only delivered their Opinion as a Matter of great Concern in that Juncture: and notwithſtanding the Noiſe your Cattel made, it was wiſe and pious Counſel; and tho it could neither command nor ſecure the Judges or Juſtices from doing their Duties, if required, yet we might have juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thoſe that had the Management of Affairs to have hearkened in ſo plain a Caſe to the Voice of the Nation, or given them or other Parliaments a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure how to confide in them: and the Judges and Juſtices, had they not received Direction from your Brother and you, were in Diſcretion and Conſcience as much obliged to omit the Execution of thoſe Laws, as that of Bows and Arrows, and ſeveral other Statutes, then, if not ſtill in force, but out of Uſe.</p>
               <p>If our Ceremony-mongers had but given themſelves leave to think, and their Romiſh Zeal would have let them remembred they were obliged to put on Bowels of Compaſſion, they would have found their Proceedings againſt their Proteſtant Brethren could not be juſtified either by Scripture, or the Practice of the Primitive Church, where nothing was ſo common as different Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, nay Doctrines amongſt them, and yet the Band of Charity and Love maintained; and Chriſtians never learnt to perſecute, till Wealth and Secular Power did attend Religion, and the Prince and Church made uſe of each other to enſlave the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Had not the Parliament reaſon to make that Vote (charge them with what Uſurpation you pleaſe) ſince it was your conſtant Practice to inflame the Differences you had made, thereby to betray us into the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Government of the French King? therefore the united Strength of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants was little enough to withſtand you. I pray let me ask you one Queſtion, why might not a Parliament attempt to make Abatements in the Terms of Conformity, or diſpenſe with the Ceremonies of the Church, when thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the Form of Worſhip, and the very Hierarchy it ſelf could plead no other Authority by which they are enjoined than ſome Acts of Parliament? Nay <hi>Sir,</hi> the Commons ſaw there was a Neceſſity of paſſing this Vote, for your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Crew had poxt a Number of Men that pretended to be ſo zealous for the Proteſtant Religion, that nothing could ſerve the turn for its Preſervation but a Popiſh Head; and tho the ſorry Rogues were a Diſgrace to any Religion, yet they were ſo dangerouſly infected, that they thought the Diſſenters were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not more dangerous than the Papiſts to the Government, tho they well knew the Diſſenters had never ſworn to any foreign Juriſdiction or Power. The Parliament therefore ſeeing ſuch a Diviſion made in order to weaken our Hands, and make us a Prey to your Teeth, made this Vote in order to ſtrengthen the Proteſtant Intereſt, by which they manifeſted a Reſolution of repealing thoſe Laws that were uſed as Scorpions by our Clergy-men and ſcoundrel Juſtices to deſtroy their quiet and peaceable Neighbours.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:100711:43"/>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Pretence ſtarts up in your Vindication, and pricks up its Ears; one would have thought ſome Countrey Vicar in his Study over the Oven had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and ſent it up to you ſweetly dreſt; and it ſtruts ſo daintily, that I muſt not let it go without its due Conſideration: What is it then? truly the Houſe of Commons iſſued out Arbitrary Orders for taking Perſons into Cuſtody for Matters that related not to Privileges of Parliament: Truly this is a pretty ſort of Pretence, ſurely the Parſon's Wife or Daughter had a Hand in finding this Buſineſs out; but it ſhall have its due Weight, and therefore I ſhall ſay theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We will ſuppoſe they did iſſue forth Orders for taking Men into Cuſtody for Matters that had no relation to Privileges of Parliament; yet that Houſe of Commons might have had this to ſay for themſelves, that <hi>they had erred with their Fathers;</hi> the Power of that Houſe concerning taking Men into Cuſtody had not then, nor to this Day has received an exact Adjuſtment, and therefore wants not Precedents of the like Nature; and if they were Arbitrary Orders, they were ſuch as had been executed by Parliaments many a fair Year before your Sires of the antient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> were born: and ſince Orders of the ſame nature had been made by Parliaments in the times of our antient Kings, theſe Orders might have been paſſed by, and not branded with the reproachful Name of being <hi>Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Tho we have ſuppoſed that the Commons might iſſue out thoſe Orders, yet they took none into Cuſtody by ſuch Orders but what might well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed guilty of Breaches of Privilege in the higheſt Degree: the Truth is, when Parliaments met annually, or at leaſt frequently, we find few or no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but when they were not frequent, but there were long Intervals of Parliament (the Conſequence of which was long ſitting, which began within theſe two hundred Years) there were ſome Complaints of the Breaches of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, as in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and in the time of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> when the Juſtice of the Commons hath been applauded by our former Kings for aſſerting their Privileges, and not ſtigmatized for exerting an Arbitrary Power. 'Tis true, the moſt notorious thing that could be fixed upon that Houſe, was the Fees extorted by the Serjeant of the Houſe, who tho he attends the Houſe of Commons, yet he ought to have conſidered that he was the King's Officer, and by Law no Officer of the King's ſhall take any Fee or Reward for doing his Office but what he receives from the King, upon Penalty of returning double to the Plaintiff, and being further puniſhed at the Will of the King; but of this you and your Party took no notice, becauſe the then Serjeant was a Creature of your own, tho I think he ſmarted for it, and your Brother laughed at his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity in the Caſe of an Under-Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Therefore I ſay, that to aſſert that their Orders that were made for the taking Men into Cuſtody were for Matters that had no relation to Privileges of Parliament, was an impudent Lie; for there were a Number of Men, who to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the reſt of their Countrey, had baſely given their Hands for Abhorrences of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and of thoſe who moſt humbly petitioned for their ſitting in a time of ſuch extream Neceſſity: their Names I will give, that you may put a Mark of Favour upon thoſe of them that are alive, whenever they ſhall have occaſion to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100711:43"/>
meet you at St. <hi>Germains.</hi> You may remember that Houſe did fall upon ſuch as had countenanced the Popiſh Plot, and were Abhorrers of petitioning for the ſitting of Parliaments, and voted that it was and ever had been the undoubted Right of the Subjects to petition the King for the Calling and Sitting of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Redreſs of Grievances; and that to traduce ſuch Petitioning as a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of Duty, and to repreſent it to his Majeſty as tumultuous and ſeditious, is to betray the Liberty of the Subject, and contributes to the ſubverting the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and legal Conſtitution of this Kingdom, and introducing Arbitrary Power. The firſt that fell under theſe Votes was <hi>Withens,</hi> that was knighted for his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring, and after made a Judg; he was expelled the Houſe, and voted a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of the undoubted Rights of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and received his Sentence at the Bar of the Houſe; he is yet alive: I ſuppoſe he and his Brother <hi>Jenner</hi> may ſet up at <hi>St. Germains</hi> for Expounders of our Law in good time. The next was Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> then Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> againſt whom they voted an Addreſs to the King to remove him out of all publick Offices, and that the Members which ſerved for the City ſhould communicate the Vote to the Court of Aldermen. There were ſeveral others that upon the ſame Account were taken into Cuſtody, as Sir <hi>Giles Phillips,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> Capt. <hi>William Caſtle,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Hutchinſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Walrond,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Stawel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Herbert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sheridon,</hi> and Parſon <hi>Thompſon</hi> of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> And becauſe Sir <hi>Francis North</hi> the Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> adviſed and aſſiſted in drawing up a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt petitioning for the ſitting of the Parliament, the Commons vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it a ſufficient Ground to proceed againſt him for high Crimes and Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: the like Vote paſſed againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Jones</hi> one of the Judges of the King's Bench; and upon Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> one of the Barons of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: but they went higher with <hi>Scroggs,</hi> for they impeached him of High Treaſon for diſcharging the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> before they had finiſhed their Preſentments, and for the Order made in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> againſt <hi>Care</hi>'s Pacquet of Advice from <hi>Rome, That it ſhould be no more printed or publiſhed by any Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Sir,</hi> what ſay you now to theſe Vermine? Thoſe now alive are ſtill the ſame Rogues, and your very humble Servants and Admirers; and I could wiſh you had them with you at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> being pretty Company, and worthy of your Favour: indeed to give them their Due, they have been pretty falſe in their Oaths to King <hi>William,</hi> whom ſome of your Party ſtile Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Theſe were the Men that Houſe of Commons did cenſure: I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> on with your Spectacles, and ſee whether the Crimes they were guilty of had no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Privileges of Parliaments; ſurely your Friends, when they charged the Houſe of Commons with this Crime, were not in good earneſt; if they were, they ſhall have a <hi>Rowland</hi> for their <hi>Oliver;</hi> I'll be in good earneſt too, and let them know, that if the Privileges of Parliament be concerned when an Injury is done to a particular Member, how much more when they ſtrike at Parliaments themſelves, and endeavour to wound the very Conſtitution? Nay in the Caſe of <hi>Sheridon,</hi> who afterwards troubled the Nation with a Litter of ſcandalous Pamphlets upon that Account, 'tis plain that his Commitment was only in order to examine him about the Popiſh Plot, and his Endeavours to ſtifle it. Do not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100711:44"/>
you know that <hi>Sheridon?</hi> Say you never did; yet let me tell you it was you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him how he ſhould behave himſelf to the Houſe; whoſe Behaviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was with as much Contempt and Inſolency, as if you or your Father had been demanding ſome of the Members; and therefore they had reaſon ſurely to commit him. <hi>Thompſon</hi> you know him too very well, he was zealous in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Breaches of Privilege to ſerve you and the Popiſh Party, witneſs his Uſage of poor <hi>Bedlow</hi> and the reſt of the Diſcoverers of the Popiſh Plot; yet his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment was only in order to an Impeachment; and as ſoon as they had gone through with his Examination, he was ſet at Liberty, giving Security to anſwer the Impeachment they had voted againſt him. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. What if the Matters upon which the Houſe of Commons did commit Men were not relating to the Privilege of Parliament, and had been without Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet you and your Crew carrying on a Deſign to root out the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which you had engaged your Brother, which was a Plot without Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, why might not the Houſe of Commons proceed againſt the Abettors of it without Precedent? Other Parliaments, before you were born, had made Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for particular Offenders, and why might not that Parliament without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Leave? If it be in the Power of one Parliament to make Precedents, why not in another? I am ſure there was as much Occaſion for new Precedents in that Houſe of Commons as ever in any. Your mealy-mouth'd Cattel uſed to wipe their Mouths, and ſay, they were as great Lovers of Parliaments as any Men, but thought it ſtrange that the Commons ſhould be ſo zealous againſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power in the King, and take ſuch a Latitude to themſelves. Theſe Hogs-heads have their Buts, a Parcel of Coxcombs that would not conſider under what Circumſtances the then Houſe of Commons lay: there was a Plot laid before them for the bringing in of Popery and Arbitrary Power, and to kill the King; and that it was a Plot, and a villanous one, none yet could with any Senſe or Reaſon deny, but ſuch Rogues as were either in it, or Well-wiſhers to it. When the Commons came to conſider of this deviliſh Conſpiracy, they found Criminals that had been by a ſide-Wind Abettors of it, and others that had been Sinners above the common rate; therefore they were forced to take a Latitude in their Dealings with them, that the Nation might not be undone by them: and where there were Criminals of this Standard, certainly a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, if they could not find Precedents how to manage ſuch unruly Monſters, might make ſome, in order to tame them. <hi>Sir,</hi> I could give Inſtances of ſuch Precedents made by former Parliaments; and if that Houſe of Commons made new Precedents, they did but follow the Steps of their Predeceſſors, who made Precedents as the Neceſſity of Affairs required; and if the Houſe of Commons had not taken ſuch Courſes, they had betrayed their Truſt, if by thoſe Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (whether new or old) they had not aſſerted the Rights of thoſe that ſent them thither. Now what becomes of this your Pretence of illegal and arbitrary Orders in Matters not relating to Privileges of Parliament, for which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Diſſolution?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> A ſixth Pretence for diſſolving that Parliament, was for their Addreſſes to the King, which I am ſure were with all the Duty and Humility that could be; nevertheleſs to allenate the King from them, you and your Party called them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100711:44"/>
Remonſtrances rather than dutiful Anſwers to thoſe Meſſages ſent them by the King. Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> it was a ſtrange Age in which that Parliament ſat; and they could not but judg themſelves under very unhappy Circumſtances, when notwithſtanding their extreme Caution and Prudence, yet all was under an ill Conſtruction at Court. Now if the Commons had returned Anſwers to his Majeſty's Meſſages, without ſhewing on what Grounds they proceeded, they had been (and that juſtly too) accuſed as Men proceeding peremptorily and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon; but when they expreſſed with all becoming Modeſty the Reaſons of their Reſolutions, they were accuſed of <hi>Remonſtrating.</hi> But what if we ſhould give your Miniſters at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, and your Brother's at <hi>White-Hall</hi> this Word, and ſo I will for once, if thoſe of them that are alive will but tell me what they underſtoood by that Word, and with what Crime they would charge that Houſe of Commons; for my part I am at a Loſs in the Point: perhaps <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Barillon</hi> that underſtood French might have given you the Meaning of the Word <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> and it may be told you there was ſome pernicious thing in it, as the <hi>Carnegey,</hi> or ſome Pox like it, and therefore it might preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice your Brother, as it had done you, you know when; take it ſo, and much good may it do you: but if by <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> you mean a declaring the Cauſes and Reaſons of what they were doing, where was the Fault that was ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily imputed to them, ſince it was a way they learned from your own Brother in his Meſſages to his former Parliaments? This is another Pretence much of the ſame Value with the reſt, and ſo let them go together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7ly.</hi> A ſeventh Pretence you had for diſſolving that Parliament, was the falling foul upon ſeveral of your Friends, and giving them their due Character; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at <hi>White-Hall</hi> would never forgive the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament for the Vote paſſed upon ſome Men then much in faſhion at yours and your Brother's Courts, which gall'd you to the Heart and Soul: truly I would not have you think this a Character the Houſe of Commons only had fixt upon them; no, every honeſt Man had done it long before, the whole Current of their Lives, Practices and Counſels, being a full Proof of that Charge: Therefore why did your Paltroons call theſe Votes illegal? Was it illegal for that Parliament to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach Perſons that were Enemies to the King and Kingdom, or to determine by a Vote who were wicked Counſellours, and did deſerve to be impeached, ſo to find out the Senſe of the Houſe?</p>
               <p>But ſince you are my old Friend, my never-failing Friend, and upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I have an old Kindneſs for you and your Party, I will with you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Votes that paſſed againſt thoſe Beaſts of Prey, were not in order to an Impeachment; yet ſtill there was nothing of Illegality in them, nor nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: for the Commons in Parliament have always had two Ways of delivering the Countrey from ſuch Vermine, either to bring them to a publick Trial, that they may have publick Juſtice done upon them, or give the Rogues an ill Name in an Addreſs to the King, that the Court and Council may not be plagued with ſuch Rubbiſh; and hereby the Countrey will know them again, and treat them accordingly. You were very tender of the Lives and Liberties of theſe Favourites, and ſo was your Brother; but I conceive their Lives and Liberties were never in danger till they had forfeited them, and the Forfeiture
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100711:45"/>
could not appear till they had received a fair Trial: Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> it's plain they durſt not ſtand one, unleſs it were a Trial of Skill whether the Parliament ſhould ſit and ſee Juſtice done, or be diſſolved and the Nation undone: this was the Trial they were in danger of, and no other; for that was concluded on by the King and <hi>Barillon</hi> in the Lodgings at the lower end of the matted Gallery. But ſuppoſe their Lives and Liberties had been in danger by an Impeachment, there was juſt Cauſe for the Parliament's proceeding that way with thoſe Traitors; and if they had been but endowed with Courage to have ſtood Trial, there would have been legal Evidence to have proved the Matter of Fact upon them, that they were Enemies to the King and Kingdom; but if there was not Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, truly then they had been acquitted with more Honour to themſelves and Families than they acquired by ſending home that Parliament. Again, <hi>Sir,</hi> do but conſider a little, and ſet your own Mother-Wit at work, and you will find that a Parliament may act as the great Council of the King, and the Wiſdom of the Nation (I uſe your Brother's own Phraſe) and when they ſaw Affairs ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and their Advice rejected, the Courſe of Juſtice perverted, the King's Counſels betrayed, Grievances multiplied, and the Government it ſelf managed in a moſt weak and diſorderly Manner, who ſhould they have charged? the King? No, you will ſay he could do no Wrong: Who then ſhould they accuſe, but thoſe that had the Adminiſtration of Affairs, that had the King's Ear, as the villanous Authors of thoſe Evils that hung over our Heads? And ought they not to have applied themſelves to the King by humble Addreſſes to remove ſuch Perſons from his Preſence and Councils for ever? You may ſay they had no Teſtimony againſt them; you know to the contrary: but ſuppoſe they had not legal Proof, yet you know to your woful Experience there were many things plain and evident even beyond the Teſtimony of Witneſſes; ſo that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible as well as unneceſſary to have had legal Proof. What if it was your Brother's Pleaſure to hear thoſe Villains? was it therefore unlawful for the Commons to conclude that all the Evils the Nation groaned under came from their wicked Advice and Counſel? and then might they not repreſent thoſe things to the Nation, that it might appear they had not been negligent in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inquiſition after thoſe Men, who had been for ſeveral Years carrying on their wicked Deſigns with you and your Popiſh Party? They imagined to ſecure themſelves by whiſpering in the King's Ear: What then? muſt not a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inquire into the Names of theſe Whiſperers? and tho they had not legal Proof to make theſe Men publick Examples, yet they had ſo much Certainty of the Matter of Fact, as was Ground enough to ſtigmatize them as Promoters of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> to be plain with you, the People of <hi>England</hi> were highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in all thoſe great Officers of State; and as they were your Brother's Servants, ſo they were Servants to the whole Kingdom: therefore who ſhould have detected the Treachery and Villany of thoſe Servants but their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in Parliament, whoſe Buſineſs it was to repreſent all the Nation's Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to the King? Certainly ſuch a Repreſentation ought to have been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him worthy of Conſideration, and not to have treated them as having made illegal Votes: but this you and your Brother made a Pretence for diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100711:45"/>
that Parliament, and preferred your ſecret Counſels before the publick Council of the Kingdom. In a word therefore, to conclude this Head, let me tell you in all Faithfulneſs, that thoſe Votes your Party was pleaſed to term ſtrange and illegal, were not ſo ſtrange as honeſt, and not illegal, but very righteous: The Houſe of Commons had before addreſſed the King for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from his Perſon and Councils, but he was graciouſly pleaſed to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Addreſſes, tho made with all Humility and Duty; nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> he was ſo far from that, that it was obſerved even by that Houſe of Commons, and many other ſober Men, that an Addreſs from the Commons againſt any evil Man at Court, was a fore-runner of his being preferred to a Place of greater Profit or Honour, if not both; it proved ſo thrice to that old Traitor <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale:</hi> and on the other hand, if thoſe three Parliaments had addreſſed on behalf of any Man, he was ſure to receive no Favour, and came off very well if he was not mark'd out for ſome Vengeance. Now I think it no Crime to tell you, that your Brother ought not to have entertained any of thoſe Vermin after they had a Blaſt of angry Breath from that or any other Houſe of Commons: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if a Houſe of Commons declar'd any number of Men, Perſons that put the King upon Arbitrary Counſels, or Betrayers of the Intereſt of the Nation, there needed no Proceſs of Law and Legal Proof againſt them before they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, tho it was but reaſonable if they had proceeded againſt them, in order to fine, impriſon, or put them to death: but to remove them from the King, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Advice and Opinion of the Nation by their Repreſentatives was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; if not, you would have allowed them time to act their Villany to the Hazard of the Government it ſelf: and till this was done, with what face could your Brother expect Supplies from the Parliament? Your Cattel at <hi>St. Germains</hi> can tell you, there are ſome things ſo reaſonable, that they are above any written Law, and will at all times have their Effect in deſpite of all Power on Earth, whereof this was one: ſo that from the whole Matter, this Pretence of yours falls to the Ground with the others before named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8ly.</hi> Your eighth Pretence was the Parliament's Behaviour in the Caſe of <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> and this was rendered a very hanious Crime, and juſt Cauſe hereby was given to your Brother and you to ſend that Parliament packing, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly after 8 days ſitting was diſſolved for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Houſe of Commons impeached him of High Treaſon. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I'll appeal to <hi>Jack Caryl,</hi> or any of your ragged and outlawed Crew at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> whether that Houſe of Commons had not reaſon to judg the Treaſons of that wretched Man of ſuch a nature as to deſerve Examination in full Parliament; and the reaſon was as plain as the Sun at noon-day, if you but remember that this <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was one of your own dear Religion, and an Iriſh Teague, and appeared to the Houſe of Commons, as made uſe of by you know who, to ſet up a Counterfeit Proteſtant Conſpiracy, in order to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot, and to deſtroy thoſe worthy Patriots who had kept their Conſciences chaſte, and had not bowed the Knee to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and betrayed the Intereſt of their Countrey for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Court. There had been many ſuch polite Deſigns on foot before (a Particular of which you ſhall have in its proper place) but they proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; but your principal Conſpirators avoided the Diſcovery, as others had the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100711:46"/>
Puniſhment, in what manner, and by whoſe aſſiſtance, the Nation was then very ſenſible: but your Villains being warned by their ill Succeſs in former Shams, grew more cautious; and therefore, that this damnable Treaſon might not look like a Popiſh Deſign, your Tools by your Appointment compoſed a Libel full of the moſt bitter Invectives againſt Popery and your ſweet ſelf; this Libel car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as much Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion as ever your Declaration, penn'd by your <hi>quondam</hi> Servant <hi>St. Coleman,</hi> did; and had as much concern for our Laws and Liberties, as <hi>Portſmouth, Nell Waal,</hi> or <hi>Barillon</hi> could have for their Lives. Notwithſtanding all this, you may remember how it inveighed againſt the King with all the bitterneſs imaginable, and incited all Men to rebel againſt him, in order to deſtroy his Perſon and yours. This Paper, as villanous as it was againſt the King, was by him, <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and her Bawd <hi>Nell,</hi> and <hi>Barillon,</hi> ordered to be conveyed into the Pockets and Lodgings of ſeveral Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, that (when they were ſeized, and this found upon them) they ſhould be charged with Treaſon and Rebellion, and the finding of this upon them ſhould be a Proof of the ſame. The Tool that was to carry on this Roguery was <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who was to be one of the Witneſſes to ſwear this Conſpiracy deſigned by the Proteſtants: and your Conſpirators had prepared the Buſineſs to be laid in <hi>Oxford-ſhire, Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Bark-ſhire,</hi> that this Villany might not miſcarry, but be believed by the Juries that ſhould be pack'd in thoſe Counties, in order to a ſpeedy Juſtice upon the pretended Criminals. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> as well laid as this Deſign was, it proved to be a Brat of Popiſh Extraction, and the Midwives were that Whore <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and truſty <hi>Nell</hi> her Bawd, with whom you would have engaged in Perſon, had not the Catholick Cauſe called for your Preſence in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but I ſuppoſe, let who will believe it that you know nothing of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I ſhall prove you in it in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Well then, the nature of the Crime, and the King your Brother, <hi>Barillon,</hi> and the two Strumpets aforenam'd being engaged in this piece of Villany, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great Perſons being to be deſtroyed, ſurely deſerved an Inquiry, which an <hi>Oxford-Jury</hi> neither could or would ever make; for they, it may be, in the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their Mercies, would have dealt with other Proteſtants as they did by poor <hi>Colledge,</hi> whom they baſely murdered, to pleaſe your Brother and you. That Houſe of Commons, as if endowed with a Prophetick Spirit, unanimouſly agreed that none but the Parliament was capable of looking into the bottom of this Affair, both in its Original and Tendency; and the more zealous they were for that, the more they ſaw the Zeal of the Judges, and the inferiour Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> abated in relation to the Popiſh Plot, and its Diſcovery, but heightned for you and your Party againſt the Proteſtants; and that thoſe Blood-hounds thirſted after their Blood, that aſſerted the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> Truly, to ſpeak the beſt I can of thoſe Judges, they were much changed for the worſe, as appeared in the Trials of <hi>Wakeman, Gaſcoyne,</hi> and others that were in the Popiſh Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and in good truth, <hi>Sir,</hi> the <hi>Oxford</hi> Houſe of Commons were the more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: and could you blame them? for when this <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was ſenſible of his Crime, or at leaſt of his Danger, and had begun to tell Tales, he was removed out of the Legal Cuſtody of the Sheriffs, and illegally committed cloſe Priſoner to the Tower, to the great aſtoniſhment of all ſober Men. That Parliament
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100711:46"/>
therefore had no other way to have the Proſecution effectual, and the Judgment according to the Laws of the Land, and that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould not lie under any hopes, but by impeaching him; for they well knew that no Pardon could ſtop their Sail, tho it might the King's. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> conſider how this Pretence of yours could juſtify the Diſſolution of that Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9thly.</hi> The laſt Pretence I ſhall mention which you had for diſſolving the three laſt Parliaments, was their bringing in a Bill to exclude you, and to render you incapable of inheriting the Imperial Crown of this Realm. This was the beſt Pretence you and your Party could make for doing ſo wicked a thing, ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Peace of the Kingdom: but if I deſtroy this <hi>Goliah,</hi> I truſt you will quit it, and let it take its fate with the others. There were many of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that uſed ſeveral Arguments againſt that Bill, which I ſhall take notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Conſpirators did impudently aſſert, that the Bill of Excluſion was unlawful, and therefore in it ſelf null and void, eſpecially ſince the King had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt it. Some of them were pretended Proteſtants, and had been for ſome time educated in the Univerſity under a Parcel of High-church-Logger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads; they, even they were tainted with this Notion, that was fit for none but ſuch as believed Tranſubſtantiation. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> if it were againſt Law, it muſt be againſt a written or an unwritten Law<hi>:</hi> if it were againſt a written Law, your Party ſhould have named it; which when they had done, they ſhould have named that Parliament that ever was bound up by any written Law, if we take them in their Legiſlative Capacity, as we muſt do in this Caſe: and to declare that a Parliament is bound up by written Laws in their Legiſlative Capacity, is both deſtructive and abſurd.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It was deſtructive; the Parliament being the fundamental Court and Law of the Kingdom, and ordained to make Laws, and ſee them executed, or to ſupply their Deficiency according to the preſent Exigency, for Preſervation of the Peace and Safety of the People, which is univerſally in them, but not ſo in particular Laws and Statutes, which cannot provide againſt future Exigencies as the Law of Parliaments doth, and therefore were not Limits to thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and it would have been farther deſtructive, by depriving thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of half their Power at once, whenever they ſhould be circumſcribed by written Laws in their Legiſlative Capacity, which is a peculiar Property belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to inferiour Courts of Law and Juſtice, but not to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which is the Supream Court, but muſt have ceaſed to be ſo, and have diveſted it ſelf of that inherent and uncircumſcribed Power, which the Safety of the People comprehends and requires.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It was abſurd in the Conſpirators to urge that the Bill of Excluſion was againſt Law, and therefore null and void of it ſelf: for the Legiſlative Power of Parliament is to give Laws to <hi>England,</hi> and not to receive any, ſaving from the Nature and End of their own Conſtitution; which as they give Parliaments a Being, ſo the Parliaments make Laws for Preſervation of themſelves, and the whole Kingdom they repreſent.</p>
               <p>As for your unwritten Law, it is to me like your unwritten Verities in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the paltry Ceremonies of a Church, that cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lawful either from the Command of Chriſt, or the Practice of his Apoſtles:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100711:47"/>
if therefore by unwritten Law, you mean Cuſtom of Inheritance, that's againſt your Party by the Practices that have been both at home and abroad; or if you mean the Equity of the thing, then the Parliament in their Legiſlative Capacity were Judges of that; or if you mean Prudence, the Parliament being the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Nation, are certainly Judges of that alſo.</p>
               <p>From all which it undoubtedly follows, that the Propoſal of a Bill to exclude you from inheriting the Crown of this Realm was in it ſelf lawful, becauſe of the uncircumſcribed Power of Parliaments in judging what is lawful, and what is neceſſary for the Safety of the People, by whom they are ſent to Parliament for redreſs of Grievances; which no written Law could provide againſt in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal way. So then it being lawful in it ſelf to propoſe a Bill to exclude you from the Crown, the doing it after your Brother had ſignified his Pleaſure againſt the Bill, could not make it againſt Law: for I remember no Law written or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, that ever conſtituted him Lord of the Articles upon the Parliament, which they were to debate and propoſe, or not: But what was his Will and Pleaſure, or the Pleaſure of two or three Villains and Whores that joined with him in uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Power, altogether ſtrange to our Engliſh Conſtitution of Parliament? And I muſt tell you, your Brother's intolerable Stiffneſs in that Particular I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think was out of Kindneſs to you, or from any ſuſpicion he had of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy by ſuch a Law, but from the Influence of ſome ill Men engaged in the Conſpiracy with you to deſtroy that Conſtitution; who knowing your Brother's Inclination in that Particular as well as yours, made it their Buſineſs to nouriſh in your Abſence a Miſunderſtanding between him and the People, whom you and he mortally hated, juſtly fearing if he ſhould ever have come to the due Temper of an <hi>Engliſh Monarch,</hi> and to have a Senſe of the Peoples Affection to him as the Father of the Kingdom, he would have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up you and your Rogues, who had infected him with that deadly Notion, that the Intereſt of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament was not only diſtinct from, but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his Intereſt and Deſigns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your Conſpirators uſed to urge another Argument againſt the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion (no doubt your own firſt, or they would never have preſumed to uſe it ſo long till it was become thredbare) <hi>viz.</hi> that the King could not comply with the Houſe of Commons in it, tho the Intereſt as well as the Deſire of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe it ſo nearly concerned him in point of Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience. Your Brother and you were both Men of Honour, Conſcience and Juſtice, of which you both made this Nation ſenſible. Well, ſince it was ſo, let me argue upon the Topicks of Honour, Juſtice, and Conſcience with you: Had it not been honourable in your Brother to be true and faithful to his Word and Oath, to keep and maintain the Religion and Laws eſtabliſhed? Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> could any Man have thought it diſhonourable in him to have loved the Safety and Welfare of his People, and the true Religion eſtabliſhed amongſt them, above the temporal Greatneſs of his Relations? Was it not juſt, in conjunction with his Parliament for his Peoples Safety, to make uſe of a Power warranted by our Engliſh Laws, and the Examples of former Ages? Or where was his Juſtice, that was the Father of his Country, to expoſe his Children to ruin, out of Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a perverſe Brother; and to abandon the Religion, Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100711:47"/>
of theſe Kingdoms, which he was ſworn to maintain, and expoſe them to the Rage of you and your traiterous Jeſuits, who thought your ſelves in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bound to ſubvert them? Your Brother by his own, might have remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Religion; and what your Brother's Conſcience was in relation to your Succeſſion, a cunning Man could ſcarce find out: but if he had been a Proteſtant, I might have asked, what Conſcience obliged him to aſcend the Throne to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Proteſtant, and ſet up the Popiſh Religion? <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir,</hi> ſince your Brother inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much upon Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience, I'll ſay of him, as I ought, that he was a Papiſt; yet I am ſure he was bound in Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience, to have preſerved to the People of <hi>England</hi> their Religion, Laws and Liberties, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with this Parliament to have ſecured them from being ſubverted by you and your Followers, ſince with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> much Duty and Affection they recalled him from a miſerable Baniſhment, attended with Poverty and Diſhonour, and chearfully placed him upon the Throne, and enlarged his Revenue above what any of his Predeceſſors had enjoyed, and gave him vaſter Sums in 20 Years than had been given to all the Kings ſince <hi>William</hi> the Norman. Where then was his Honour, Conſcience and Juſtice, in leaving them to be deſtroyed by you? It cannot be ſaid he had therein more regard to the Government than to the Perſon that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, ſeeing if he had paſſed the Bill of Excluſion, he had no ways preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced the legal Monarchy, which he did enjoy with all thoſe Rights, Prerogatives and Powers which his Anceſtors did ever claim, beſides what he uſurped againſt Law, which yet the People quietly ſubmitted to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Argument your Party uſed, was, That it was a hard Caſe that a Man ſhould loſe his Inheritance becauſe of this or that Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> had your Caſe been only ſo, I ſhould have thought your Argument pretty ſtrong: but alas, Popery was not in you and your Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, an innocent Perſwaſion of Men differing from others in religious Matters, but a real Conſpiracy againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf; nor was this Inheritance your Cattel uſed to mention, a bare Inheritance of a private Perſon, without the Conſideration of an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ce annexed to it, which required you to be <hi>Par Officio.</hi> I pray what did your Logger-heads mean, when they made ſuch a Noiſe about an Inheritance? nothing leſs than a Government of three Kingdoms, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of ſeveral Nations, the making of War and Peace for them, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Religion, the diſpoſal of all publick Places and Revenues, the Execution of all Laws, with many other things of the greateſt Importance. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> theſe inconſiderate Perſons were mightily out in their Claim: for the three Parliaments had reaſon to look about them, when they had reflected upon the Bloody Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and more particularly upon the helliſh Conſpiracy then diſcovered, and at that Time carrying on with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour by your Popiſh and Popiſhly affected Traitors: and finding you to be the avowed Head of this devilliſh Party, could you with any Juſtice think they ſhould not prevent as much as in them lay your being a Shepherd, ſince you had declared your ſelf a Wolf? And ſince you were a Papiſt, how could they believe you would ever appear in the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion? I think this may ſuffice for this Argument.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100711:48"/>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Argument againſt the Bill of Excluſion was the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance taken to your Brother by the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> Truly I never heard the Argument from any but an Iriſh Man, not but we had then Fools enow to invent ſuch an Argument, as we have at this Day to attempt your Reſtoration. But their Arguments were as ſilly as their Plots; and this is one of the moſt fooliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could be uſed againſt ſuch great and wiſe Aſſemblies as thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were compoſed of. Give me leave, <hi>Sir,</hi> to put this Queſtion to you: Suppoſe you had been found guilty of Treaſon by your Peers in Parliament, or in any Court of Peers, and the Caſe ſo plain, that you had been condemned and executed for that Treaſon; whether or no that Parliament or Court of Peers that had condemned you, had been guilty of a Breach of their Allegiance, and Murder? This you cannot ſay: then I muſt tell you, that ſince whilſt you were Duke of <hi>York,</hi> you had made your ſelf obnoxious to the Government in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, why might not the ſame Authority proportion the Puniſhment, and leave you your Life, and debar you of the Succeſſion? This is to ſhew the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity your Crew were guilty of in this Argument.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſpeak one Word by way of Anſwer: Whereas your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators did ſay the Bill of Excluſion was diametrically oppoſite to the Oath of Allegiance taken to your Brother and his Heirs; no Man could bear Allegiance to two Perſons at once, nor could Allegiance be due to a Subject: the Word <hi>Heirs</hi> obliges no Man till the Heir is in Poſſeſſion of the Crown, then the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fixed by virtue of the Oath made to his Predeceſſor. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> do but conſider what Miſchief your Party did to the Succeſſion it ſelf for the next Heir by their way of prating: for by it they let looſe your ſelf from all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and Penalties of human Laws; ſo that you had no other Ties upon you not to ſnatch the Crown from off your Brother's Head, than purely thoſe of your own Conſcience; and what they were, the Nation quickly ſaw.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Argument you and your Conſpirators uſed againſt the Bill of Excluſion, was, That it argued a Diſtruſt of the Providence of God. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> was our Care to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion a Miſtruſt of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? and muſt thoſe that were thus zealous, be judged Men of little Faith? God forbid. 'Tis true, I cannot allow the leaſt Evil to be done, that Good may come of it; but the Bill againſt you was juſtifiable by the Laws of God, and the Conſtitution of the Government: for, <hi>Sir,</hi> look back and conſider how the Proteſtant Religion was firſt eſtabliſhed here in <hi>England;</hi> it was indeed by the mighty Hand of God influencing the publick Counſels of the Nation, ſo that all imaginable Care was taken both by Prince and People to reſcue themſelves from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Yoke, and accordingly moſt excellent Laws were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Uſurpation and Tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> our noble Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in thoſe Days did not manifeſt a want of Zeal for their Religion, with a lazy Pretence of truſting God's Providence, but together with their Prayers to, and Affiance in the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> joined the Acts of their own Duty, without which they well knew they had no reaſon to expect a Bleſſing. And a young Whipper-ſnapper, a Friend of yours, in a certain Coffee-houſe had prated at this rate till he was plentifully kickt for his Pains, which was the beſt Way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſuch a Coxcomb, that was not to be anſwered any other way.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100711:48"/>
               <p n="6">6. Another Argument againſt the Bill of Excluſion was this: A ſtanding Force would have been abſolutely neceſſary to place and keep the Adminiſtration of the Government in Proteſtant Hands; and the Monarchy it ſelf would have been deſtroyed by a Law, which was to have taken all ſort of Power from the King, and made him not ſo much as a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi> This I have heard your Brother talk, but it was when he was drunk; and this was the Talk of your Party, drunk or ſober: truly they had little in their Diſcourſes but Abſurdity and Incoherence. Sometimes they would ſay, the Government, and Succeſſion to the Crown was of ſuch Divine Right, that nothing could leſſen your Right: nay, ſome of them were ſo fulſome and nauſeous as to talk of Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to baniſh you out of your own Dominions, and to deprive you of your whole Power of Kingſhip, after your being actually King: but truly this naſty Cheat appeared ſo plain to the Parliament, that one of your profeſſed Vaſſals, who had more Honour than the reſt of your nonſenſical Paraſites, was aſhamed of it, and openly renounced that ſelf-contradicting Project, which they had been ſo long contriving, and thought they had ſo artificially diſguiſed; but tho it was ſo well-favouredly expoſed in the Houſe, yet your Coxcombs thought the Nation might be deceived, and therefore bluſht not to offer it in their common Diſcourſes in all Places and Companies: but who they converted to the Cauſe, I never was curious to inquire.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> was a ſtanding Force ſo neceſſary in caſe of your being excluded? ſuppoſe it was: nay, I will go farther; ſuppoſe a War had been neceſſary, yet would it not have been a War juſtified by the Authority of Law, and againſt a baniſhed excluded Pretender? There would have been no fear of its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; no true Engliſh Men could have joined with you, or countenanced your Uſurpation after ſuch an Act; and as for your Popiſh and French Adherents, they would neither have been more angry nor more ſtrong by the paſſing that Bill.</p>
               <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt be plain, and tell you, that your being excluded when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> would by no Means have neceſſitated a ſtanding Army for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government and Peace of the Kingdom; the whole People of <hi>England</hi> would have been an Army for that Purpoſe, and every Heart and Hand would have been prepared to maintain that ſo neceſſary and much deſired Law, for which thoſe three Parliaments were ſo earneſt with your Brother, not only in purſuance of their own Judgments, but by the Directions of thoſe that ſent them, to remove ſo great a Grievance from the Nation, as you then was, and continued to be till you were graciouſly pleaſed to let us know that one pair of Heels was worth two pair of Hands. Your notorious great Grand-mother was excluded by Act of Parliament, yet Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> enjoyed the Crown with much Comfort and Peace for 44 Years, and needed no ſtanding Force to ſecure her from that pretty conditioned Gentlewoman's pretended Right.</p>
               <p>Again, a Word more to this ſtanding Army: I wonder that you and your Party ſhould be ſo afraid of what you ſo eagerly deſired; nay, ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ventured a hanging to get one eſtabliſhed: If I am not much miſtaken, I have ſeen two Armies raiſed for no other Deſign than to bring in Popery and Slavery, as was proved to the Shame of him that raiſed them; and the firſt was as ſhamefully disbanded, as it was impudently and againſt Law raiſed: but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100711:49"/>
the laſt Army you procured to be raiſed, you and your Party were ſo unwilling to part with, that two Acts were paſſed before we could get them disbanded. And after your Brother had thrown off the uſe of Parliaments at your Inſtance, he ſo increaſed the Number of his Guards, that they became formidable to the People of <hi>England;</hi> who being a free People, hated ſuch a ſtanding Force. Now why your diſſembling Raſcals ſhould uſe this as an Argument, I am yet to learn.</p>
               <p>And as for that Objection, that it would have deſtroyed the Monarchy by a Law, and taken all ſort of Power from the King, and made him leſs than a Duke of <hi>Venice;</hi> this was as falſe as could be: for, as I have ſaid before, ſo I muſt again, that it is evident beyond Contradiction, that the Bill of Excluſion could not prejudice the legal Monarchy, which your Brother did enjoy, with all the Rights and Powers that his Anceſtors ever claim'd, becauſe many Acts of like nature have paſſed not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in your <hi>quondam</hi> antient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without danger of diverſting the Monarchs of their legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Preſervation of a Government conſiſts in, and depends upon an exact Adherence to its Principles on which it was founded: and the eſſential Principle of the Engliſh Monarchy being that well-proportioned Diſtribution of Powers, whereby the Law at once provides for the Greatneſs of the Sovereign, and the Safety of the People, for this Reaſon our Anceſtors have been more careful to preſerve inviolable the Government, than to favour any perſonal Pretences. And in your Caſe we followed the Examples of other Nations; I meet with none in Story ſo ſlaviſhly addicted to any Perſon or Family, as to admit of a Prince who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed a Religion contrary to that eſtabliſhed amongſt them: it would be eaſy to produce a Multitude of Examples of thoſe who have rejected Princes for Reaſons of far leſs Weight than the Difference of Religion, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering the Monarch's Power, or the Subject's Right: therefore your Party talked like Fools when they ſaid the Bill of Excluſion would have diveſted the King of his Power; nothing could have made a King of <hi>England</hi> ſo much look like a Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> as one of the lowſy Expedients your Party propoſed to the Houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Argument againſt the Bill of Excluſion, was, That it would have led the Parliament to attempt other great and conſiderable Changes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by endangered the whole Government, and the Peace of the Nation. Now what your Villains would have had the Nation to underſtand by this Change, is worthy of Conſideration: Therefore, firſt, if by a Change they meant a Change of the Conſtitution of the Government, let me tell you that Hell could never have forged a more villanous Lie than thoſe wicked Wretches did, that they might in conjunction with you inſtil ſuch Thoughts into the Mind of the King, as might effectually alienate his Soul from the Uſe of Parliaments. It is evident even to theſe Hell-born Wretches, that there was no Vote or Propoſition in either of thoſe Parliaments that could give any Ground for ſuch a malicious Reflection; and therefore in this Matter we that were Lookers-on might reaſonably charge your Brother and you, and your whole Party, with a malicious Deſign againſt all Parliaments, in thus arraigning the whole Body of the Nation upon thoſe ill grounded and malicious Suggeſtions. I am ſure this did not become the Grandeur

and Juſtice of Princes, nor was agreeable to the Meaſures of Prudence and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which you ſhould have governed yourſelves. And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I will give the true Reaſon why you thus delighted in theſe Men, <hi>viz.</hi> your hating Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being afraid they ſhould have called you and them to account for your high Crimes and Miſdemeanours: by this Means, together with the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of your dear Brother, you ſo ſwayed him, that you could never want Grounds to diſſolve not only three ſuch Parliaments, but threeſcore, if there had been Occaſion.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Place, <hi>Sir,</hi> If you and your Admirers had underſtood by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting great and important Changes, that the Parliament would have beſought the King, that you might no longer have the Government in your Hands; that your villanous Conſpirators ſhould no longer preſide in his Councils, nor poſſeſs all the great Offices of Truſt in the Kingdom; that our Ports, Gariſons and Fleet ſhould no longer be governed by thoſe that were at your Devotion; that Marks of Favour, and Characters of Honour ſhould no more be placed upon ſuch as the Wiſdom of the Nation had adjudged Favourers of Popery, or Penſioners to the French King; theſe, I confeſs, were great and important Changes, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Engliſh Proteſtants to believe were deſigned by thoſe Parliaments, and would have been by any other Parliament your Brother ſhould have called in his time, and ſuch as the People of <hi>England</hi> would have prayed for, and left the Succeſs to Almighty God, who governs the Hearts of Kings and Princes. Truly without theſe Changes, the Bill of Excluſion would have ſignified little; it might have provoked, but not diſabled your wicked Party: Nay, the Money the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have paid for it, would have been uſed to haſten your Return upon us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another Argument uſed againſt the Bill of Excluſion, was your great Grace and Favour for your Countrey, and the Excellency of your Temper and Vertue. Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you had heard theſe Men magnify you for your excellent perſonal Qualifications, you would have ſpit in their Faces, and told them they lied; for the Violence of your natural Temper was ſufficiently known, and your Vehemency in exalting the Prerogative in your Brother's Reign beyond its due Bounds; and the Principles of your curſed Religion, which carried you to all imaginable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Cruelty, convinced all Mankind that there was a Neceſſity of excluding you, rather than to leave you the Name, and place the Power in a Protector: for in good truth, they muſt have looked upon it as the greateſt Folly to have made ſuch a Change in the Government, which would have been a Means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, and not preſerve the Government. <hi>Sir,</hi> they ſaw your Temper, that you, who was bred up in ſuch Principles of Politicks as made you in love with Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, and bigotted to that Religion which always propagates it ſelf by Blood, could never bear with ſuch Shackles as would even diſguſt a Prince of the meekeſt Diſpoſition: this was your Temper; and how it is amended ſince you placed your ſelf at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> I ſuppoſe your Followers can tell better than I.</p>
               <p>But what Regard and Favour you have born to this Nation, was well ſeen from your firſt Return to <hi>England</hi> in 1660, to your leaving it in 1688. You engaged it in two wicked Wars with the Dutch, and a third with <hi>France.</hi> I would not have your Cattel low too much of your Grace and Favour: but truly if you had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100711:50"/>
for this Nation, you was pleaſed to conceal it, except in two things, in which you did <hi>England</hi> the moſt ſignal Service that ever Man did; the one was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Brother, and the other your running away: and if you will keep on the other Side of the ſmall River that parts <hi>France</hi> from us, we will forgive you all the Faults of your Life. But notwithſtanding all the Noiſe your Party have made about your Excluſion, I think they are now fully ſatisfied, or at leaſt may be, that thoſe three Parliaments that did proceed to exclude you, had juſt Grounds for it; ſo that all your Pretences ſtand convict as fooliſh and impertinent. Now theſe things being thus, can any Man judg you otherwiſe than an Enemy to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that way of Engliſh Government, which made you and your Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſo much inveigh againſt their moſt juſt Proceedings?</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I intended to have made an end this time with you, but there is ſo much yet behind, that I muſt have another Touch with you before I leave you: for you know a Picture that is not to all Intents and Purpoſes perfect, is but a ſilly Buſineſs, and not worth the viewing; and what Faults there are in your Picture, your worthy Ally will ſeek to have mended. Old <hi>Hodg</hi> I hear, as old as he is, ſwears rather than you ſhall not ſit again, he will (now the Trade of Obſervatoring is out of doors) turn Fidler again in Ordinary to you, he may help you to many a penny worth of Farthings by doing a Job at a Countrey Wedding for your Neighbours at <hi>St. Germains;</hi> who, tho poor, yet are much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with fidling: I pray ſend for him, for I queſtion not but he is Rogue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be imployed by you in that excellent Function.</p>
               <p>Another thing I requeſt is, When your humble Servant the broken Souldier bauls againſt me about Perjury, and Perjury upon Record, that you would adviſe him to put in a civil Word about forging the Seal; you know it is not unuſual to lay the Hare's Head to the Gooſe-giblets: they ſay he can dance better than he can talk; let him attend his old Friend <hi>Hodg;</hi> we can ſpare him, <hi>Sir,</hi> to ſerve you when you ſhall command him, for I think he is lewd enough for you to make what you pleaſe of him: his three Couſins were once in hold, and it vexes him to the Heart that he cannot get them again to engage in a freſh Plot, no not ſo much as to make a Swear that the Seal was a good Seal, if his Life lay on it: good Man, I pity his Misfortune; I am afraid the ſcarlet Cloak muſt once more go to pawn at ſome Pawdy-Houſe or other, but it can procure no great Sum, for it is as thredbare as my old Gown; and how to help my ſelf I know not, till our King ſhall be pleaſed to do me right.</p>
               <p>There is your other Friend, that would have been a Lord in your Brother's Reign and yours, or the Lord knows what; he uſed to walk with Sir <hi>J. Fenwick</hi> in the <hi>Mall;</hi> and tho Sir <hi>J.</hi> is decently ſent out of the World, yet he's a conſtant Advocate to bleſs his Memory, either for fear or for love, with his good word, by defending whoſe villanous Cauſe he pleaded his own. You know he was a dutiful Child to his old Dad, and let him have 400 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to drink Ale withal in his elder Days; the old Gentleman could have diſpenſed with a Bottle of Claret if his dutiful Child would have let him enjoyed his own: you would do well to move your Brother of <hi>France</hi> to make him a French Count, or ſome ſuch Buſineſs; for I am afraid if he ſhould wait till Doomſ-day in the Afternoon, he will not get

Upon my Word, if you would have his Company, I do not think any of our Eaſt-land Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants would mourn for him, except in Sack and Claret. When he was in play, he was ſuch a falſe Card, that a whole Pack of them was laid aſide; and ever ſince he bellows and roars like a Town-Bull, that the Children here cannot ſleep for the direful Noiſe he makes: he has had his old Friend <hi>Hodg,</hi> with ſome of the inferiour Clergy, to give him Ghoſtly Counſel; but he ſwears and damns, that nothing can do his Buſineſs, or give him any Content like being made a Lord, therefore what to do for him I know not; the poor Man is in a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and 'tis high time you give him ſome eaſe, before yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Be not in a heat, but let me tell you of another humble Servant of yours, that wants your good Company, and that is Dr. <hi>Graines,</hi> a very ſweet-fac'd honeſt Prieſt as ever broke up a Church; his Father was a poor honeſt Hoy-man, and gave the Rogue a little Learning, and in time he aſcended the Pulpit, and made ſome Earnings; he hath a ſmall Concern in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he brews now and then a little Ale to refreſh his wicked Soul: but the Man is extraordinary wary in his way, and ſells his Grains to the Poor, in <hi>propriâ Perſonâ,</hi> at a Half-penny and a Penny <hi>per</hi> Bowl. I conceive he got more by his incomparable Ware-houſe, he knows where, than by the Merchandiſe before mentioned: the Man was popular, and the Neighbourhood where he once lived, brought him with great Honour to a certain Place where he was well known, and better truſted than with his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, whoſe Pockets he would have pickt of ſixteen Shillings; but the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was as jealous of his Honeſty, as all honeſt Men that know him are of his Truth and Sincerity to the Government and the Proteſtant Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſecured his Money, and diſappointed the poor Prieſt of his Deſign. I once had hopes, that ſince you was ſo gracious as to ſend him into <hi>Wales,</hi> you would have had his Company with you, for you uſed to ſay he was Company for any King in Chriſtendom: it is therefore much he ſhould be left behind, having been a mighty Tool for you in your time; and therefore <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> and a certain other Perſon of ſome Quality, did give him all the countenance they could, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Opportunity for him to breathe in <hi>Wales</hi> ſometimes for the Health of his ſweet Countenance. The Man is humble, and therefore refuſed not to lie in a Friend's Houſe of yours, tho he was but pooriſh, he being a hearty Rogue that hath ventured hanging for you, as may be teſtified in due time.</p>
               <p>I once happened into the Company of this Northern Welſh Prieſt, and he gave account to ſome Ladies of the good Company he had at his Houſe when in the height of his Glory, and complained of a prodigious Quantity of Damask Linen he loſt, all made up by his own Mother, and marked with the Creſt of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I am not to queſtion the Veracity of this goodly Parſon, for his Father was an honeſt Hoy-man, and his Mother was a Pudding-wright in the Town he was born, and now and then brewed a Buſhel of Malt againſt a good Time; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſold her Grains or no I cannot tell: but as for Damask Linen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ever ſaw any in her Life, I muſt leave that to your Friends to believe if they pleaſe; but this I know, he never deſerved ſo great a Favour at her Hands, for I remember when he was aſhamed both of Father and Mother. But let him
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100711:51"/>
go as he is, I could wiſh you had him with you, as alſo that logger-headed Prieſt, who for his Learning, Parts and Honeſty, might have been <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chaplain <hi>in Extremis,</hi> he having been ſo deeply engaged with him in that glorious Deſign, for which he hath juſtly ſuffered Death as an abominable Traitor to God, his King and Country. This Prieſt lives and wipes his Lockrum-jaws, as the Whore in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> and like an impudent Rogue ſaith, he has done no Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. I do not queſtion, <hi>Sir,</hi> as infirm as I am through your Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but to live to ſee an end of his ſuppoſed endleſs War, and a happy Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I am of opinion that his Plotting againſt the Government hath been more his Maſter-piece than any Sermon he ever preached. I conceive him ſo well fixed here, that I doubt you will not have his Company, tho I do not find him a Fellow of any great uſe to his Party, unleſs to lead a Mob to diſturb an Election of Parliament Men in <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Buſtle he made in the laſt, he could do you no great Service.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Matter of Fact, with which you and your Brother and villanous Party ſtand charged to the end of the <hi>29th</hi> Article, I ask you, What you think of all theſe things, and how could your Party behold the Face of the Engliſh Nation, or your Scots Villains their Country, which they have ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed and betrayed? Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> what ſay you to all this? Was not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> right in thoſe few Paſſages of his Declaration, that more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly related to your Perſonal Vertues? Truly had he ſaid nothing, yet theſe Articles are ſufficient, which are ſo fully proved, that I defy your old Obſervator to confute any one thing mentioned, or your Scotiſh Scribler that is become a hearty Rogue in your Cauſe; he hath ventured hanging for you, and I hope will in due time meet with his long-deſerved Reward for all his Villanies. Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi>'s Lady, notwithſtanding his great Care of her Husband's Library, will not put in a Petition againſt it.</p>

Poor <hi>Pilgarlick</hi> fought two Days together at one of the Campagns that you opened, and came off by the lee, tho he had a good Sword, and fenc'd as well as any Man in Chriſtendom: but you may fare better than many an honeſt Man; and I conceive my old Landlady will be content that you ſhould rather retain your old Name, than be guilty of ſuch a Piece of Raſhneſs; ſhe may come and act your part for you, unleſs the <hi>Virago</hi> Part in her Ladyſhip be decayed for want of its due Exerciſe, and may win more Credit than ever you had. But do what you will, it's all one to me, I am <hi>ad arma paratus,</hi> I dare try a touch with you and your Party at any time. I would have you know I do not tell you this now you are at ſuch a diſtance, for you and your Villains have had ſeveral Trials of Skill with me, and in ſeven or eight Fights I never loſt the day but

Your Friend <hi>Robin</hi> was no ſooner out of Pound, but he made an Elopement to the loyal Club at the Pope's Head in <hi>Cornbil,</hi> and it's ſuppoſed did give but a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Account of his Confinement, but a far better than he gave of the Lady <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s Books, or of the Widow's Bond of a hundred Pounds, which in a moſt Chriſtian manner he forſware, hoping to have paid her with a falſe Oath the whole Sum he was intruſted with. The Villain once ſet up for a Saint, and then your Villains hated him to the ſame Degree that God and all good Men do at this time. I ſuppoſe he hopes that if you ſhould make your Abode <hi>in Partibus Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinis,</hi> you may procure him to be made a Popiſh Biſhop or ſo, which is the leaſt you can do for him, for I aſſure you he is Rogue enough to wear the Title of an Arch-Biſhop, tho it be of <hi>Bell-Iſle, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhant,</hi> or ſome ſuch Place: he is yours, dear <hi>Sir;</hi> I pray take him to you, and if he has any Hairs growing on the Palms of his Hands, you may ſafely ſwear by the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi>'s old caſt Smock, that he is an honeſt Scot, and as fit for your turn as the Deel can make him.</p>
               <p>I have much wondred he did not face about in your Brother's time; he might and would have ſerv'd to join with old Maple-face in the Trade of Book-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and have given you a Scots Palm for a tickling Sum, and that in a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent way than the Iriſh Bogtrotter did: but the Truth of it is, he was as one born out of due time, for he came not into your Villanous Cauſe till Hanging came in

               <p>I ſometimes ſee <hi>Tumbledown Dick,</hi> that is a pretty Fellow I aſſure you, and very well ſhaped, for he is almoſt as thick as he is long, and very acceptable to your villanous Party, and underſtands ſomething of Heraldry, as he pretends: you put him into a pretty Imployment, and made him a Colonel, and he would have been Governour of a certain Place, but was prevented by a ſeaſonable Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho the Raſcal never underſtood any thing of military Diſcipline but what he learned from a certain Bookſeller's Boy, with whom he would have been very familiar, but the Boy eſcaped his Love; ſo that my Gentleman had not the Underſtanding requiſite for a good Souldier. He was once a Profeſſor of a great deal of Engliſh Truth; but your Brother and you had a cogent way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſuch Cattel to your Cauſe and Intereſt.

If that good Lady has not been a great Croſs to you, the Devil's in the Dice: but in my poor Judgment you had more need get clear of theſe Articles if you can, and get a good Name if poſſible, than go whining about for a lowzy Croſs.

               <p>If my old Landlady wants a female Servant, I can more eaſily help her than I can you to your Crucifix: ſhe is a worthy Perſon I aſſure you, and a Woman of an excellent Reputation; ſhe knows how to plant behind the Hangings as well as you can for your Heart's Blood, and has given as good Proof of her Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100711:53"/>
in that Piece of Service upon a Relation of hers, as ſhe has of her Reputation for many Years laſt paſt, notwithſtanding the wicked Aſperſions thrown upon her, good Woman. I pray be pleaſed to admit her into my Gammar <hi>Sweetapple</hi>'s Service; I believe you are all ſo much alike in Vertue, Honour and Truth, that it is pity ſhe ſhould be a Minute from you, tho her <hi>quondam</hi> Gallant ſhould cry his Eyes out. Your old Eves-dropper ſhall attend her, and you may take him as Paper and Packthred into the Bargain, and the rather becauſe he is a French Man, and ſtood behind the Hangings to ſerve you and your Brother's wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon an honeſt French Proteſtant, that applied himſelf to him and you (not knowing you to be a Papiſt) for the Security of the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>France.</hi> Now I rather propoſe this, becauſe you your ſelf were planted behind the Hangings or Wainſcot with old <hi>Coventry</hi> and your old Chymiſt, to hear what paſſed between your Brother and my ſelf, when there was ſome Diſcourſe to be in relation to your ſweet ſelf, and old <hi>Kate</hi> of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> What Advantage you got by your Eveſdropping, I know not; if you got any, much good may it do you: but upon the whole Matter, I think I have made you a pretty Propoſal, and ſhould be glad if it takes, for I would fain have you eaſy and comfortable in your Company; for you know the old Proverb, <hi>like to like,</hi> as the Devil ſaid to the Collier. Now for all this Piece of Good Will, I deſire nothing of you but a Coat the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> made for her Son, which is at preſent in the Church of St. <hi>Martinellus;</hi> for my Coat is very thredbare, and I have been told it is as freſh as when it was firſt made: now ſuch a Coat that will never be old, would do my Buſineſs, for I cannot tell when I ſhall have a new one. When you come to <hi>Rome,</hi> you will be ambling from Church to Church; I pray call in there, and beg it for me; ſince I have been ſuch a Friend to <hi>Rome</hi>'s Chair and your ſelf, they will not deny me that Favour, being ſenſible of the great Value I have for you for the many gracious Obligations you have laid upon me in particular, as well as upon this Nation in general, for whoſe Honour you have fought many a bloody Battel; but old <hi>Hodg</hi> ſwears and damns too by his Treble and Baſe Viols, that he cannot tell the Time when, or the Place where you entered upon theſe noble Adventures, except it were between a Pair of Sheets with <hi>Jenny Roberts,</hi> or ſome of thoſe noble Fireſhips that were rigg'd at <hi>White-Hall</hi> or St. <hi>James</hi>'s: and if by any of thoſe noble Adventures you did the Nation any Honour, you have met with a competent Return of our Gratitude, eſpecially ſince you were ſo great a Sufferer by one of them, for whoſe ſake you wear a <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have but one thing more to ſay, and then you may go and dry the Clouts whilſt my Landlady gets the Welſh Tiler to Bed, and that is this: Doth it not appear as plain as the Sun at noon-day, how you have not only in conjunction with your Brother ſham'd the Nation, but been alſo ſham'd by your Prieſts and Rogues, and by your Pope and French King, and your Paſſive-Obedience and Non-reſiſtance-Rogues here in <hi>England?</hi> For the former, that is your Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, how were you fooled with their lying Fables? And had you not been bleſt with an Iriſh Underſtanding, you might have ſeen they were For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries and meer Fopperies: they told you of their Houſes being the Houſes of <hi>Cloe,</hi> and their Houſholds the Houſholds of <hi>Oneſiphorus;</hi> but alas, they were but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100711:53"/>
the Sons of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and villanous Offspring of curſed <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> and take them from their Uncleanneſs, what they ſtudy is nothing but impoſture and Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. Theſe were the Men you countenanced: <hi>Beddingfield</hi> your Jeſuit was a Pimp, a Drunkard, a Whoremonger, and a Sodomite; yet you uſed to ſay he was a holy, humble Man. What ſay you to your <hi>Sabran,</hi> that was a Reproach to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Scandal of <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> or to your truſty <hi>Ned Petre,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> two notorious Villains, one famous for his Ignorance, and the other for his Impudence, Drunkenneſs, and Blaſphemy againſt God and his Word? What ſay you to your four ignorant Popiſh Biſhops you procured to be made? theſe were your Counſellours. As to your Religion, I pray what have your Popiſh Crew done for you in your Diſtreſs? Nay, how did your old <hi>Odeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calchi</hi> leave you in the lurch? 'tis true he told <hi>Porter</hi> you ſhould have his Prayers; but if they had been worth a Groat, or half the Money, you muſt have gone without them; half the Money would have perſwaded him to have given you a <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I pray in the next place, what's become of your mighty Ally, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great? How ſtands his Friendſhip with you? What uſe have you of his Purſe and Aſſiſtance againſt your Enemies? how fares it with your inſeparable Intereſts?

But I ſuppoſe the Purſe his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty offered you the uſe of in 1675, is not yet drawn dry; if it be, the Lord have mercy upon you, you have no other way but to try whether the Officers of the Treaſury in <hi>France</hi> can with old <hi>Maple-face</hi> fall to the Trade of Book-cutting, and cheat the French King of a good Sum: for if Begging will not do, Cheating muſt; and 'tis all one between you and the French King, ſince your Intereſts are the ſame. I pray how is my Landlady's Intereſt? Is hers and the French King's the ſame too? If it be, old Boy, you have no reaſon to fear but ſhe will get her Living and yours too, not by the Sweat of her Brows, for that is too mean for an adopted Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> but in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And what think you of old Sir <hi>John Greazy-guts,</hi> he that had the moſt comfortable Opportunity of cheating your Brother and your ſelf? he is in his old Poſt; but if you ſhould truſt in him, all Mankind muſt ſay you are at your laſt Prayers.
